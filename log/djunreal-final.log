oh yes I'm running a shotgun so that's why it's not in the enemies
insuring shotgun mode
that will be what's doing it
I forgot Mrs a shotgun run
how does a shotgun on a grenade launcher
yes yes exactly
and yeah I can still die just as easily as always
don't worry just got a shotgun on a grade laundry doesn't mean I'm any good at the game
shotgun is very weird for the setting it what VXR Griff is Reading of having an assault rifle is weird enough
the fact that you can get an upgrade that switch is it out for a shotgun needs a little bit nuts put two that's what we've got
that is what we got
so yeah we going through we need help so Darkness is what we need even as a boss fight

it's worked his life out again
and the something
but definitely something
Anna probably shotgun mode is the range on the sing it is not great
but it does basically five three shots at once
which is happy
multiple shots at once is always handy
that is not where you're supposed to rain monkey
is not the right thing to do
just respond sorry I'm helpful of them
I said that
you put the contacts not you department
ok yes I will definitely take that I will definitely have more damage after slaying something
I take that burritos because we like a burrito
good yeah I'm not playing it in God mode
it looks like we got here at Hermes Hermes all Honey's
I want to watch I'm going to use
yeah he was going around for
I do some Dash deflecting
upset somebody's enemies of it
no look it's only me that supposed to be able to do dashing and damaging
I'll take that one out
thank you
that's not what I gave you
psychosis school
yes I thought we want that bonus money
how are you doing tonight
doing
if we carry on the next train but we need some opinions from chat
I got this cold interesting
we had a slight upgrade on it we've had some text that is Mike
I like the way this could do with the text being slightly lighter so it's a little bit different in terms of reliability
let us know it be great to have something in Thomas
we will make sure that it is barely readable good but at the same time why keep that neon look if we can
let us know what you think in chat would be great to get something else
writing a bot for some streamer
the text on the microphone itself so you see where the microphone is got lovely blue glow on it and that's because some texts
so I want to know whether you were thinking is be lighter whether it's about right or what age my how you doing good to see you
what do you mean where I think that's your vote cast then
it should be obvious unless you struggle to see blue butts
what we're wondering is a little bit lighter is ok the way is you now
you're coming will indeed create more work for KSP
very eager
I'm ok so haven't got that we are going to die straight back in Hades we got a shop
everybody loves a good shop
tidying up the Hades way
you turn on Dark mode please see the text but light stop it ok
that's useful tonight
have
disease
I'm in the max health is always useful
are we going to a full bossfight yes we are
I think that maxhealth is the
option here
that is a mockup
it's a stock photo online from somewhere
but that is anyway we can like my steering this is no any that Titanic nowhere near that tidy
I mean look at this there is no way that anybody knows me would ever think that I would have a desk that tidy in a million years
you know that that is some lovely
but too far to meet for me
we've got a boss fight
horribly
oh yeah the end stream is going to end soon end Street machine is gonna be all somebody happens
absolutely awesome
that is gonna rock
mysterious and Theseus
Nike case we don't do this professionally you do it for fun
you don't think I'm going to pay him do you
he's not very polite Izzy
he's not very polite at all
this is not going to go well
unfortunately even though he has a shotgun I have to be too close to him
there is one death in mediately
how good are we got rid of the minus or
this is not go well though
yep see not going well at all
will go with the stainback approach
stay back
organised in approach
which actually seems to be working better than I expected it to
I don't tend to do this whole
oh come on
that's not very fair
calling an Aphrodite
I've decidedly unfair
this is a decidedly slow fight compared how it could be
that was not a good move that was not a good move at all
and is not God gauge
how many days survive long enough
which almost didn't there
it just a bit more god gauge
where is a serious
how to get data in on the case
get her to do some damage
I mean or appreciate it if you can actually get it
which she isn't
that did not work too but that's kind of understandable
Scotsman vs indeed
design work is very definitely cool

what have we got round here
nothing there nothing in Leigh
useful locations
cerberus is employee of the Month
employee of the Month service

what exactly help is always good

let's have some 0 drapery

we have taken my skills we have low taking the most the overall top spot
profecto taking the most most assists
random space monkey pic of couple of Centurions girls tonic DK picture of a flying rogue
mumble is not morally
a rude
author DJ request we read the room
are you Big Bang Theory yet
ok and we got a circus kidnap got a call we got some other rewards to pick up don't forget to pick up all the rewards
and then of course check your quests
we have one there 50 of them Focus which gets another like they're asking
make sure you check the rest of your quests
but more importantly we gonna kick off in the battle we can get this sorted we gonna die straight on him
if you haven't done the battle before Hitler Lincolnshire get yourselves on over
open to all it is free to play
Paris flag bearer ok like they replaced
we could do that
you can definitely place fly papers
so get some units down we will see that in about half an hour's time
I want to go for the day today
epic summer road epic template very nice
chamber without a fight
yes will take the twin shot we haven't heard this all before
definitely take the screenshot
the house
I've got a convenient chamber Darkness talkies
today I'm talking quicker ok that's unusual
I mean I haven't changed so fast I took
I think the boat was just half asleep
no this twin shot is excellent
that is doing some serious damage
that is easiest damage to me
ok
we don't need a result of the 150 healthiest special when will probably lose most of it
over the max health upgrade
sometimes I would do the trial

peanut butter cookies

Marmite peanut butter cookies probably
I think I do better with dash tried to be honest
ok this is going to take some getting used to
this is
name sexy getting used to
beginning early
what have you got in the Money Shop
nothing useful
I got a feeling this could be a very short run depending on Homer
these next Glasgow
I have burritos
and it starts training
he gives us some speed that might help with some of the stuff that was going on
it felt like I was getting stuck quite a bit
ok
excuse me
quite you
get off
and you
call Suki Jimmy
are you going to take flurry cast as cool greater haste is cool
ibis Bristol take that this time
ok that's pretty cool
I can see why work like this one
what's going on glitter kittens attacking you again
is that was happening I suspect it might be
we know what your kittens are like
the trouble
something is Santos not a miss
I wish I had a text Anna says not me
ok we want that apparently
they'll hang onto this
chaos
I definitely ok us there
I don't think we got the hell for chaos
now we've decided not got the house of Chaos
we do have one to do the truth because money when we got a shop up next
your kittens want your buttocks
vantage sorting out other word
Celtic 79 gold
79 goldrill do nicely
free money for the shop
the shop we go
make a Patty already
what is on spoil s
evil things
and some more money
have a good feeling about this shop
special stronger with chance to do prick
although it's always support fire
always always support fire in the situation
and a boosted supporter fire even better
always good support fire
this is where I come into its own now
Everytime We Do damage
that was not good
how
this is not the quickest run with ever done
hurt
is not going well
I thought I could destroy those things by shooting them
apparently I can't
I don't know it's quite rocket it's going
on the matter
we'll see what happens
ok so
we have thunder dash which is good
under Dash
I already get speed boost on every Dash
so having a speed Boost and a lightning strike is w dot
only going to more points
are you to hear me talk about talk of excellent yeah OK speak close it quite a bit and was encouraging I should
so I picked it up the other day
I will be playing it at some point
that wasn't very polite
I think they died
didn't know
new
no look
you didn't try you successfully explained it
you also said I should learn the maps before I start doing anything online with it
and I haven't yet had chance to win the maps will learn amounts rather
therefore
following your advice
because that's what this comes and it is you gave me a nice and following that advice
you can't rescind that advice now
is it too late for that
simulation attempt
will it say something
explain the games about chatback seating ok
what are we got ok we got a trial of the gods start god is always the thing to take
hurt like hell
I'm Going To Lose Yourself to work
loser sounds and testifies at least
patron of the gods is always the correct option to take in these situations
let's see if there's any health knocking around before we go into it
know you by breathing
what is it about their breathing annoys you the fact they're doing it all the fact they're making noises whilst doing it
is it anything to do with making noises whilst doing a good fix I wanted to
there we go
you know have been welcome to back
unlock is not a correct command unlike is the correct
yeah let's take
Artemis first
hello
or take another property option
oh dear
uses of an option
I'm going to get zaps no matter what
and I knew I was going to die at least once
that was inevitable with the matter health I didn't have when I came in here
Zeus is helping me out anyway half is lightning strike
I wasn't planning on doing twice though
once I was expecting twice not so much though
if I die again that's the end of the run
if you're writing something wrong
Artemis's awesome with coronavirus
lightning also makes clothes jolted his always a good chat
are there any health pickups anywhere around here
anything no
ok we got a shop
the shop the shop is a wise choice
ok sweet favourite stream riddle
Artemis is excellent yes hello cheeky are you doing
also we can take the bone or we can take
the heart and the house
r&l
lucky Jackie meeting meeting sound unpleasant
and the question is do we think I've got any chance at all
I've been successful against
Liam Byrne Hydro
offer health gauge and no testifies
Home Health gauge no justifies
burrito
already got electric heads out
that's the initial extra head sorted
that was a waste of two god shots
can we do this
perchance
I just got hit
the homing arrow is on special the homing Arab is on everything
it's on special it's on attack and is on cast
that was a hectic get run
do it all in the fingers well all in the fingers is one way of putting it
that kind of works ok
that works alright
yeah mate will get droid infrared sometime as well
I'm home now until 5 you should give 5:00 history
and that she is more than 5
8
it was at least 8 shots there
shots + 8 homing Arrows is bonkers
you can say the names if you want droid
say the names if you like doesn't bother me
got no money
tos violation of fair enough
did not realise that
anyway
ok so damn it seems like
the special only gives oh no that time it did give me multiple
it seems sometimes it doesn't it doesn't
no ego
what's the hammer give a spider stomach in a boy clothes
yeah but it's not showing my photos
don't messages also healthiest place
Messi played a free dash face
to free up storage space
occasionally you shoot each other as well
hello 31 Darkness out of it
Patterson health
we're short on money
do the money but we can also do the max else
I got to do with not dashing into the explosion that bad happened
I may be at some point will stream some took off maybe even get somebody was on there with us
can we do now appear to hit that follow ago
no idea how cause
any new followers but
so we'll do something for that
no he's not he's dying
sbm door for OSB have to play tarkov
or we Gon
money
volunteering attributes
and I was going to play soccer with us
as we told me so I must be true
KC definitely told me
that's exactly what you told me
never Street if you kill him in the radio code on the following oral
you've going to a raid as a scav
and you kill another scav and therefore
available for killing
this is a thing
I'm told youkilis caviae then you are expected to be killed by another scarf
if that's on positive be told by the rules
perfect
with the camera system
a question of course is Will You
I left the shop
people back if you have if you are
negative or whatever is that means that people can kill you for free
yes
I'll go on then will take all of them
cross track
let's have another answer miss
dislike this one is butterflies are irritating
as all the enemies that spawn as a result of the butterflies
this is going to end it with me dying
probably
that is 3 m will take care of that in just a moment
and that is what you want you want that Artemis got games right on the bus
prevent Sylvester from spawning
my preventing more from spawning
you better chance of actually killing was left
do that thing
a good evening wick how are we doing the enemy spawns already the worst bit of an Encounter
12% pay cut for cutting 70 hours that's impressive
they went back on here
coven
yeah we using special offer bid on this
we have not got a lot of health though
so we can probably do with the darkness
yeah I'm doing good
you said you didn't use a 17 hours
264
pretty quickly
coming into fight with five health against these things
Riverside policy
especially when you have this annoying habit of blocking things
no that was no fun
aylesbury theatre
top tips when shooting Arrows shooting towards the enemy not away from it
efficient
it is not looking like a particularly healthy run
yes let's have some else
and some more myself
very nicely
that was not very nice
somebody's have a word with somebody's enemies
baby refrain from attacking me
yeah this is not gonna go well this is not gonna good run
my whole approach of trying to be a bit slower more sensible is not ideal
yeah
that is not always not a 25th that hosts
how you doing
Anna Spelling soup on YouTube so bad I did keep a very bad idea indeed
poop waste a good soup
definitely not good for you
how you doing tonight when it isn't
well spotted
monkey
what's that monkeys is more appropriate
we are in fact
is that time
yeah avoiding the question is always wise what are we going to do we are going to stay here spell down on this lot where most people are
and with 33 Amazon the field as good guy
so now come on link come on
I think there might be words had about that
I think my AdWords William
I don't know she's very impressed with that suggestion
enclosed yeah that works
that works indeed
is looking pretty good
working with my skills are with 13 and the top spot we got laser the most assist with three
I don't know what body game you mean this rules of a random ksb and tonic dkb got 50 gold each of us getting 7 and I get 15 good luck in those personal chess always and we're going to boss fight
let's take a look and see what bossfight we've got going on
tomato soup good make a soup
we need to throw down another healer get some assist from healing so let's do that let's put a right in the middle ear
but left in the middle but close enough
yeah get some UNISON we'll see that in about half an hour
Hyundai to spectacularly badly in that one
will find out there help
paw Patrol drug and give us healthy yes please
dringhouse back is very good at this point in the game
I'm pretty sure you're next
going to be with a boss
I take the shop Next which won't be the fight
because it's a shop
103 health
solid thing to get out of that
let's go to the shop
jangled helyar about a hell Bunny
sounds
obscure
ok we can either take the boon or we take the darkness and the pom
are we going into full boss fight we are
with one best if I don't think we're going to do very well in Spotify
Wonder Stuff I don't think you can be very well at all
but I think I should probably take the boon in the situation
damage your dealers chance because I thought we already had one of those
do we have something to give us great chance
no we don't ok yes chance to crit I know it's only 2% chance but
2% is better than no percent
you're asked my friend to stop playing destiny
and then you ended up playing with him
that is not ideal
yes that's why we're here
I'm just going to keep crashing and hoping that as much as this possible goes crit
is there more dash strikes I do that do extra damage from lightning and extra damage from cold
nextra from The Seeking arrows
he's going to call him god power any minute
which will be sorry angel clothing
this is not looking at all good
I've got dionysius open in ok
dinosaurs killed me wants
yoghurt
taking down the bull
I do wish she didn't have so much
and this one I can just keep dashing around and laughing in lightning and I think that will work
the doctor's app has done the job
should I say 4 out of your escapes last night I saw the first one
the first escape was excellent
morning 50 hits of secrets out of a thousand arrows
I really are some of what I saw
yeah I was quite pleased with that that actually worked which is unusual
you enjoy watching it you'll get very frustrated playing
great Escapes in a row wow
no that's not what I wanted this is what I wanted
what is the shop got
3 money is not enough money
075
some people like to eat century
is the part of the furthest you've got with the boat
no pets allowed
definitely no pets allowed
because one down
nobody told me that before nobody told me that
each other
no we mention that at all
you probably why I was
you doing that
ok health
definitely
I don't have a deflect which is always annoying I could do with a dyslexic deflect would be useful
Edinburgh featuring themselves
yeah serious is basically want to do first anyway
it seems
this is looking like a decent combo
between all the
sitting hours and everything else is looking alright
and the lightning is helping I think
this I can just run around laughing with lightning
which is quite cool tactic
run around 11 gives up on the head
and dealing with trash is much easier that way
that's not efficient way of doing things
mirror was trying to get the
poison thing and it didn't get the boys something
poisoned and killed
thoroughly unpleasant and helpful
I should not be allowed
I should never be allowed
poison doesn't eat suck
turmeric pieces
definitely ripped pieces
amethyst seems grumpy
it is very grumpy
ok you can have a Nectar
Alexa
yes we are
and you might not have an extra as well
let me give you one ok
so like that
no you say that
That's Amore nektar
and get Nexus always a good idea
Renovations you can do today
afford any Renovations
we can afford some more music
I want to keep the diamond for darker first
possible
what have we got here
50 darkness no that's not worth one of those
use for nectar when we got 15 keys so
we can do that
illustrator lemon
you unlock everything in the mirror
rewards
spam is fine spam is fine
have we got here
legendary Boons
divine pairings quite cool
you only got one more
disenchantment for the sword to get
34 the BO2 the Shield one for the spear
one for the fists
and 4 for the gun
depending on which one wants to give us just check this I don't think there's anything to do here
no we need 3000
we haven't got
he wants us to do a fish from
Saturday the 2nd time
again we don't need to add anything to
I'm not completely this run yet
and he's very keen on it
attack deflect special deflect
cast effects attack deflect
most because of the extract boost
level is French trinket
I probably should but I keep forgetting to change it
very nice link
very nice indeed
what I mean it half works it says you've ended in that direction doesn't mean arrived
just cos you ain't it there that doesn't mean got there
Chelsea's
ok I'm going to give us
oh dear
don't want a half test
moana
yeah I will take this song
answer Darkness
ok he's boxing gloves of working alright
what kind of string do you think your sis
thank you very much
remember that behaviour on in the Stream
that's annoying
don't need to buy that house I don't particularly want to do a caravan fight just yet
as tempting as it is
I think willder
add straight into this minibus
yeah there are ways you can donate if you wish to
it is entirely optional but if people wish do they can
yes we'll have divine Dash
that doesn't work on my freaky

oh good I've got my dash back
with a minibus I guess who in the darkness
inner soles to help back it will lose on me Moss
make a Pokémon that target awake but doesn't respond the week yeah all of those will be in paintings to do
ok the special on that is slow
on the plus side I got all my health back
I'm going to get diagnosis
not jealous which is been there done that and got the scars to prove it on steady on
what you choose to get up to in your own time is entirely up to you
we don't pass judgement here on this room
spare tarkov
spare toggle
I would have got to take
don't have any pick up next I received one nectar
is useful
suddenly muscly
houses in CO4
I haven't got a call yet
so I think we'll take one
not having a cold as a terrible idea
we got to survive 40 seconds
what curfew
you put me in a room with lots of things that's very tight
and expecting me not to destroy the hack out of everything
and I got fair enough Justice
yeah this is not going well for the enemies
I'm hoping this is only me some decent cash
is emojis that we kill the more money you'll get
who reminded me a nephew
especially comes a charge shot
longer range
no 3 hit sequence but deals 40 base damage
340 base
what's a shop got
nope let's go for the pump
about the state of furniture
strong attack what are they predicting
will I mum
do not mumble any commands
I do not mumble any commands
now now
who's misbehaving
I mean she's a bit grumpy
I don't know what is it triggers that rage
weather is just when she gets to certain health percentage
where there's anything more involved than that
channel predictions Ireland entertaining way to earn channel points
that was a relatively easy bossfight
as call fortune ethic artillery dance very nice
register Homebase that would make sense
all the games didn't seem to go up slowly it went up a tiny bit and then jumped
alright in we go
what is not a change of scenery we come here all the time
what have we got we've got Hermes
oh good we got baby golden
I kinda need to die as soon as possible
stream with a few drinks study on
tasty I think he's saying that he mentioned earlier again to spare key still he might be interested in it
I think that's what he was saying
drink gaming before
it could be entertaining
could be disastrous but it could be undertale
ring Raiders is indeed or not just heard the noise
take the spoon first
I need to pick boon and we're going to have
dodge chance
adult chance is the best option here
it gives us the best chance of not being killed quite so quickly
we do indeed need to do stream Modus
the noise and we have a boss fight
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to work
no not the quickest and because that would be
suboptimal what I want I think is
let's give the ranged unit some boost this time
arrangements just about there 51 hours on the field is an absolutely cracking number
and see how we go
was in tarkov you have to escape from everything
other players mostly
other players very definitely need to be escaped from
is a lot of Russian going on here
5 hours left they are doing plenty of Killing
look at Alnwick DK up there with the orc Slayer sitting on the top kills we're getting knocked Up by claims court just as we say it
is charter flight back is China retake it Clans is not having any of that
The Wombats left to kill and one of the enemy which is a rock which doesn't have a few enemies underneath it
plans is not having any of it
he is so he's going to keep that top spot
you can keep that most kills
we're going to find out
everys advancing on the Rock The Rock is very little
the rock is dead so the units underneath it that was a massacre
as an absolute Massacre with client school taking the most kills with 13 and no not there
start by turning DK with that combined 17
unless they're taking master system 11 completely shaking everything up and yes glass is made it a lot of soda work
10 kills from the Range those roads at random
monkey picking up monk greatest Park picking up two centurions and tonic DK picking up one centurion
gold and of course as personal boss
blocked nose
what's a decent cash to take this top Road to try and get this local disk in chest
so let's keep throwing them down
that's high praise their nice
yes that's what we need phone line down there and then go and sort out those quest around and don't forget that the hand of question don't remember that
turn the question get yourself some free rewards
and remember to upgrade your units as well
very important
Steam account I do not recommend let them do that was a very silly idea indeed but welcome back
get those units on we have half an hour
tell them though
we have more killing do we have the twin fists
when upgraded do in terms of their damage
plenty of lava to stepping
the pommel some money we are
I say that we're going eventually right and when he left the money
I don't know ok but more money is better
sanitise
we're not going to win this
you just doing too much damage
yeah we didn't win that
I don't know I heard you're pretty good work
I heard you're pretty good
Macbeth get a free Max selfie yes
essentially we can basically guarantee pretty most that will recharge
health that we had that we lost
we only needed 9 but we got plenty
any possible knee no
ok got a gemstone until we got a shop
nectar
shop
5-minutes left on the 10 subs offer
I mean it's tempting
but it would cost you a lot of money
what's it going to replace
no definitely not
your money
interesting
he said that if I started playing talk I won't continue to the rest of the string within an hour of him saying it
10 subs to the Channel
but I'm not necessarily so that's a good idea
effects special damage
what do you mean why not
tech tested it I'm not check whether anything works properly
I haven't got a clue what I'm doing
I'm saying it's not you so much for that cheer
really appreciate it
texting very
make sure it's actually going to stream with
no massive lag everywhere and not destroying everything
what do you mean shut up
spec testing is a very important thing to do
there is no excuse
boon rarity epic

in fact
we now have the answer to that question
this question is money
unlucky Seamus you gotta put the laughter Vee
doesn't work the other way round
in KSP does command about to be created saying that Seamus can't spell if you spell barrels like that
and who has a twin
get some points congratulations
you don't do pointless commands
are you sure
let's do some fishing
fishing is apparently important
I didn't realise we had a famous
I did not realise we had a shame it's come and when do we get one of them
when did we get a Seamus command
2 minutes ago I wasn't watching that
I just got right off the screen light by
Seamus has been deleted unlucky Seamus
I don't know KFC doesn't like you very much tonight does he
delete
honestly
anyone think you too upset each other or something
cancel culture yes something like that
channel points needed for a command
that is fair
do you want your own personalised command to be made the way you want it you do need to spend 100k channel points
takes quite saving up for apparently
you're halfway there
does that mean Living on a Prayer
lovers tiff
what they get up to in their spare time is entirely up to then we don't judge in this stream
I need a key command do we
you're not judging just an observation
that's valid
accumulative points golf 4age command
what would you want the command to say or do you want to give her a choice when you get to the community goal
yes I can Windows 10 blinking
you want one quad
one-and-a-half quadrillion points is a lot of points
quintillion quintillion
somebody knows master better than we can tell
escape the shop
do you have to watch
is a valid point and well presented
it's a very very point of my presented
is here a bunch of times
be careful if you set that then people will actually go for it
will actually do it
will take years I don't know
it might not
yeah but you're not going to die in the meantime cos I'll be very careless
for your health
buying is genuinely bad for your health
ok would you go for this again
see if we can defeat them this time
I see the moon come when I got here for weakening the mum backstabbing then
asanzo thought is actually can be really useful because you've basically got to backstab
anyway
you have no choice but the back standing
ok that will be his power up then
where's the monitor going
I hopefully to hell
yes the little has indeed gone to hell
ok thanks yes that wasn't very nice where are you
we got that that works
in distress at post stream
nobody said there was any talk I'll going on post stream
we have one traders in our favour
what is the best time I've ever done that fight
or best way of ever done that fight
I don't need to buy that don't need that
my third one is good but when You're Sixteen candles long
has the most
damaging that photos bin
Wickes join us
we bought the game
did whip by the game
is wic joined by the game
when is took off yes
there's a fishing point out to do some fishing
which doesn't have the spare cash
study on link studying
Willow don't call up before
I'm not sure this is a good idea using the Douglas and Away
could you get to random power-ups and could completely change the way that my
weapon behaves
it is tempting
but it completely randomly Changes Everything
what is whether I want to run that risk of a random
redesigned my weapon
I don't know what we think that we think that we take this
dial sandal for removing one and giving us two random
if you donate to get wick took off
I think about that whilst I go into this next bit
to take some money
what she joining in on now
listen to us make fun of each other there's no making fun going on
Nelson Burns money
authorised tarkov
any of the properties I have to be up for work in the morning
tarkov doesn't work
I mean you're welcome love with my boss and complain
tell him that I shouldn't have to go to work first thing in the morning
yeah very welcome to put in a complaint in that regard
still having come afterwards
you get that but remember you don't care
I have such an awesome chat don't I
datastream Rosehill take care and just a moment
the right to kill first
and some more the exploding things
where's the last explain he's over area
aspera
that was some nice money 100 of it
Alexandra money 100 money is always good
PayPal donation
I mean he can be less than €35
don't forget there was that
who's selling it for significantly less
edit persuade Wickes about it
if it was to buy then
that's worth the discount
ok yeah will take some life crystal
he's not buying it you are ok
fair enough
it seems legit to me
you need a permit which can speak and run you
Amy's will the box his backside if you post a link in chat and the answer is yes unless is permitted by and what so I'm not committing
oral I whichever one is
at one point it was funny but both thing to work
yeah this poison is nasty
what are all over there when there's one just there
a lot of killing going on here
I'm really hoping there's a health board at the end of this
which there isn't
yeah that's what I picked it up
and which if you usually honey browser add-on you can get a discount on top of that
they have a separate discount code the Heineken 5
give you a bit more cash off the total price
I don't know user ID on but it's worth grabbing just things like this
this is not a sponsored streamlined but that's my experience
damage on fusing call
yes
you don't be good idea it is always an excellent idea
three discount codes are never a bad thing
talking not bad things stream Motors is not a bad thing
thing that needs to be done
and we have a decent number of units on the field here
which need to have a Spell
I think we need the defensive spell right about here because it looks like where a lot of fighting is Gonna Go
so with 40 hours on the field
oh wow thank you so much Kiki really appreciate it
greatly appreciated thank you so much
I owe you that apparently
ok panic DK taking the top spot and the most assist with fives and Les they're taking the most kills of 11 loads of water go out a random twin by picking up a bomber scroll Wycombe and picking up three tanks rolls and a copy of tarkov apparently everyone couldn't 5 gold and me getting 7
we're going to take this bottom right here on the top set
what are we going to do now
we are going to jump straight in and throw another unit and I need to place more flight Paris flag there as it is
there's a plantera
that is in on the battlefield
get that started

how you doing that
it was not a fluke we can do it more than once
it have sub to extreme African extreme4 for a gold star
overpowered with this particular boom combo
overpowered with this combo
and essentially what we basically had was
Itachi stronger than deflect with you always help because I'm spending attack a lot
we had revenge damage
we have bonus damage after every call
weird hangover effects making false lower special doing more damage and knocking back we weren't using that all that much
weird trippy shot
bonus damage on the fountain
we had bonus god gauge boost
bonus damage on the knuckle
stiff legs
we had also chance for dodge
we have deflecting also exposing photos
we had a Dutch after every call at the holy shield
and we had hangover on the call that was a serious combat that was a lot of Bones
yeah so the bus I'm using a mostly
keeping me alive
as much as anything else
I will take the Titan blood
B Sharma ok

Lauren autumn is aid
that's not very polite at all
that is not very polite
after party is the one to take at this level
we didn't take an art after party at this point you would be problematic
very problematic
so
restored health
we still need health and lots of it
and that is why
we have a bottle of stops you for linking
do not tolerate that kind of behaviour
we do though is
very difficult decisions
I've never seen a child of the gods at this level before
do the honours and band that but that would be greatly appreciated thank you toasty
time
it is
is
where is easier to beat
that's not very nice of her
yes any damage has a chance to be critical
triple goddess
Madden go to badly
excellent generous is good
yes Dash playdrift
and 75 gems yes please
NE38 138 is good
let's take the path of least resistance on a kettle on low health worker back to write how you doing
looks like we're getting another took of partner
chat decided whilst you were aware that they would done fund Wycombe and getting the game so that we can I can play with it as well
make a curry
curry
that is 3 m
we do indeed need the key to get the game as well
and then we have the Ultimate Team
then
money or pump money
am I earlier convenience check my discord in box of food
I will check it as soon as I finish dream
my speakers have food whilst on streaming
won't be able to talk and while some might decide that was an improvement
that's kind of not the way the street works
what is a shop got
yeah will take that life
Western human fall flat
I never seen you play Human fall flat so I wouldn't know
I feel like there's a funny story here
I feel like there's a very definitely a funny story here somewhere
evil things
you take the moon
go fishing
Kickers fishing
mama
you think in the future
and therefore she should buy it now just because I was going to happen eventually
going to boss my we should take the health
totally Take the house
I mean there's logic
and there's logic to it
excuse me
that was not very polite
you are rude
we don't tolerate rudeness on this stream
I work if you can have a word with your girlfriend
this is not acceptable behaviour
nanodroid
and yes indeed I might come out wrong
Eccles way Corby screenshotting that immediately I'm sure
you know what works like
a screenshot will be taken
typing is getting into trouble
is it your typing is getting into trouble
yeah but the thing is work without screenshots nobody will ever believe you though just assume you've made it up
I mean I'm just making a sensible observations
and I forgot to change drink it therefore I know have a pointless trinket for the whole of the next run
have a trinket the boosts on buffed
traits
which is no use at all
yes I know but I completely failed to remember that I could switch
is partly a failed to remember that I had the wrong one in my hat
evergreen icon Philippa screen phone yet I don't know what that was all about
ok money pom or balloon
spoon because
might my just born
no
I am decided the incompetent I can't even remember that I can change my trinket
I have the wrong oil in my hands
therefore you know
is initially immediately not good
Lidl please note
apparently the hypetrain cooldown as finished
tropical scene

it is actually the Perfect Weapon for this minibus
no yeah

yes strong drink
is that the only option it looks like it is Genesis
but we have 3 motor take care of so let's do that first
it is time for a Street Motors battle
we have
28 hours on the field
spell right there
let's get it going
they're not doing a lot of moving that he smells kind of redundant
a little bit
my flag bearers are buffering the one unit next to him that's doing nothing
this is ridiculous
it is thoroughly ridiculous
I got one assist out of that because I was busy but in the unit doing nothing
whose unit was that
somebody don't know
secondary schools with 18
this was sex and better taking the overall top spot
be picking up like gold a getting 5 Golf Course 34 me and loads personal chests
Anna sui the last battle of the night so get units in we've got half an hour left
eastern spice Loughborough solar baritone
and we'll see that in 30-minutes
is units on down
what is a p units and not everyone that some people
and have you got satisfied
how to be with ladybird level 26 not all that much you get
get Scrolls every time you place a unit so
place in units regularly
you get more Scrolls you can also spend some your gold in the shop to get more Scrolls
yeah this bow is not a good one for beating thanatoast with
he's one this one
I basically just unlocked there
entirely unhelpful
the answer is a lot maybe
how you do get enough gold for occasionally
we got we got a Hermes boon or without a pump
Hermes bhuna is
I could do with a bit more speed
Catherine Barton quarter garages name survive just
this is not a mini boss but it's as bad as my boss
yes have some Doom
and we cranked up the Shaka
that's nice that's not helpful now but it's nice
or we think
I think after using call game dodge chance
model shop
I got health autopump shop
Buttery roll that one mistress
yeah we rolling is not something to do
dice
the Mechanics for gaining Mordor
definitely take that help we definitely need at least on
we're going against the
favourite friend of ours Ernie
we got the wrong trinket
when to use them but Hermes exception noted all got the wrong trinket solicitors go horribly wrong
don't know destefanis left pretty much
1
he will mind he's a grumpy git
yeah but one guess if I
we have got Doom on special
and special is particularly excellent against early
stripping in all opinions of alabina string
opinions are allowed
I'm just a bit rubbish at times with working out what I'm doing
I do like the way the special for basically shreds these heads
when you eat them
ok that's all the word that defines gone
this is not good
it is not at all good
oh Holy pack
there is too much going on here
I want my awesome is being back from last time
oh my seeking arrows
any battle plans yeah we can do a battle plan
I can throw down in species as we just don't let me do that
throw that battleplan down right now
so bad Hall planning what are we going to do
zoom in on here
let's have some tanks there
let's have some Archers there
let's have some assassin's
female units
up there and across there
few monks
IKEA and then everyone can just chill
and will call that planned
and if you see a plant pop up on the screen now you should be able to put things in the right places
and hopefully that will do the job
enjoy
let me know if it doesn't show up on your screen because there's no save button anymore
I used to be a save button for vans
it doesn't appear to me now
it worked perfectly imperfect
it's not a very good battleplan but then nobody promised are being high quality planning going on
is a promise that would be a plan of some sort
oh we're going to wind him up
just need to exist
or obvious it would be very upset when he finds that
oh come on
I was making a complaint about now
next very upset
no don't upset Nicks that's a silly thing to do
ok grumpy are you
I mean that's a proper shut up and do what you're told moment
the fish
hey JP welcome back
absolutely dress absolutely
what do the keys want now
yeah sure you know so various
yeah no worries glitter no worries
thanks for hanging out
why you no
I want to
not enough
trouble is a relative thing
relatives trouble
gemstone for keys now that is a worthwhile trait
that is a worthwhile trade
ATS Huyton lilacs
a nice floral arrangement yeah it's not very happy about that
tents
surprised I didn't get out of that as well
the dog now has a comfy cushion
inspired yes inspiring the shaded in the chamber is all solarus

I did not mumble
there's no mumbling going on there
that's quite handy
don't be silly toastie that is not what I said
SKS being naughty
that's actually good shape
probably run this little bit
I got a shield run this is bad
shield runs require something adding
to this
boys we don't get the bonus bounties
damage control we can do it it's only one extra hit her
that's not very polite
the start
when is take that one anyway for the
prophecy
Jesus
Jesus
metal die
Max house
more maxlife always wise
and darkness which gives us more Max health as well as replenishing health
again always a good thing
just decided to stop biting me
annoying bug so had to remove that
it has been dealt with don't worry
ok
is not a speed run
haha heads Up indeed
yes you can tell while not a speed runner
and she's not very well either Rishi
on the plus side you give your bones and bones are good
yes
I'm going straight for the darkness
this is very definitely runaround weapon
and the Nautilus
yeah that strike is very good with only with some weapons
some weapons it just doesn't work very well with other weapons it works great with
it's an interesting one
strikers
it's only overpowered if you get the right combination of Boons and weapons
some weapons where strike is useless
there are some bones that make it
there are some that boost it to the point where it is just obscenely good
that's a decision you got to make based on what stuff you get
definitely take a call because the right choice is always to take a call if you haven't got one
rainbow dash trike is best
I don't think there is a rainbow dash striking this
I like all things for the Shield though is that every hit different knots and back a bit
which helps
Aries
potentially means we can get some Doom
what are we going to get coronavirus
shield of Chaos indeed
yeah ok cast can be play Drift
we can do that
cosplay Bristol work
I can't remember what the combo was that we used the last time we cleared all the way out with this I know it's documented somewhere
I have chaos
I couldn't have helped to do it
what was the shop got
that's worth it because I won't take chaos and not live anywhere near as much
yeah well Take That
option with some money
what cows can offer
chaos is so inspiring sometimes
or we got we got slippery stroke
mains grasp
RC atrophic lunch would be great except
32 healthy a lot
yes literally strike
I didn't see what we can't turn
I just love the gems or money though
exit is not Darkness we can earn that
to the shop
Marie back of the fureys
hello
what take the duo
and will take Greater evasion
and will take health
I'm good murder murder murder murder
I'll take my money immediately
yep there we go
the room is getting smaller
the walls are closing in
I'm in the Shield to spell overpowered
she can do the floor thing there we go
she's one we can defeat fairly easily with the Shield
now the special On The Shield all right but he uses in this situation
having a special that basically throws around about sea of multiple enemies is no use when there's only one enemy to Vanquis
yeah it's quite cool when you've got multiple to deal with
multiple definitely
now all we need to do is we need to change up our trinket
I do like taking the
do so drink it because it just gives me so much more health back
also calls I use all the time
everytime I get charged
it is such a handy thing is based in the bonus free attack with extra damage
broadcast is good but I have to remember to use
Artemis coolest fantastic yes
I still not worked out what this last lot is from
I'm no idea who gives you this one
it'd be good to know who gives me this
Champneys
today
which has an idea who is who do you think it is awake
and it would go back with what works for us
I would like to know if you can tell us
spoilers spoilers
ATM silver logo
already gave him
nectar in the past
which is normally the trigger to get those
but if there's something else you get that from him maybe by Killing him a lot I'm talking like that that's bored
somebody else gives you it just forgiving the nectar
and yes recording learney
we got that fire in
Ernie
ages of stubborn when you're not wrong there
this is not the right weapon to fight the witches with
Hanukkah the damn things have a habit of running away
I mean the special on
spell dissolve right as on hit them quick enough
and smells just a bit ridiculous as soon as she would goes flying off somewhere
don't really have much you can do with it at that point
is it's Elsewhere and you're not
which is unhelpful
always look for the pots
no more pottery good
they're not Goldwing Zeus Zeus
and what we have there is 3 m
solicitor this is battle and then get straight on in the Stream Raiders
there is a chaosgate there will be with that next time
best unlocking is quite cool on this weapon
I'll come along
more
why is there always more
anyone think this is hell
yeah dash lightning strike
it is time for Street Motors
hello there we got some giant rats
for the last time tonight what are we going to do we are going to throw a health spell ride around here
camp
28 units on the field for the last one tonight let's get it going
44 enemies to kill
that one and a half each
we can definitely do one-and-a-half animals eat
latest boxing at the top 11 most kids at the moment Les they're taking over there sitting up there with 8 and that combined top spot as we sit on the assistant although less doesn't seem to have anything to do a system is a dead so if somebody was going to take that kill number will they knocking off
what buses do what buses will do
not got the top he will get notified by glitterbox is anybody
is going to take the most kills as well
you taking up talkSPORT now getting her skills in at the last second
knocking down most kills with 10 glitter but KSP take some assist with three and the overall top spot
course means that those rewards go out around them
gold wicker man gets centurion videos get 6 gold as well
best of luck in those personal just for the last time tonight we will see this again tomorrow evening
it is unfortunately that time of the Strain
we know what happens we queue the music
ringing underage
we do want to share this creation so do stick around for that please
the more the merrier
I was gifted a sub earlier to somebody I saw it pop up in my channel
so we are gonna go and write them and say hello
just been gifted that sub is a great thing to have
is it literally Tony we know him well
persona 5 strikers tonight so gonna say hi to him so do stick around for that
tomorrow night as always
silver no thanks for watching

the logic is impeccable
if it's time for a Wednesday night streaming must be Wednesday
it's always if you can set you can buy it
India going back to ancient Greece tonight
as we put out yesterday
find ancient Greece
ancient chips
absolutely
it just occurred to me that the chat maybe new subscriber only mode if it was it is now not
indeed I did say that it's got a long time ago
so I was trying to talk and I couldn't
should be able to now
it has been fixed
anyway there's always going to kick off with some streamers
we don't get this going
we have another bottle to do
this track is test shot starfish with wonder star
the Bandit test shot starfish won the start of the track
fantastic group
SpaceX used for the instrumental of beginning in the end of the launch videos
I know very kind of stuff I can use as much as that because I like without any licences or anything like that
very good indeed
what have I got in three battles kill some bugs
level 20 get assists
test shot starfish
just like that
you're very welcome buddy
hey Kiki how you doing good to see you

right there
I'm going to roll this down slowly
just like that
have a good fight now and again on you
then what's the point in having proper mixer
what about things
it's not worth doing if it's somebody else
that's my policy on his legs
talking things that is and isn't worth doing
I said in the 80s
and have a true here for some Darkness which will give us some health
take
Wi-Fi using
the Shield
excellent
a fantastic combination
lightning strike dashes a shield for clobbering things with
we did have a call from one of the Gods
he hasn't Darkness
that is a good
would not have help with money
set health because the money is good but the health is better
I'm going to take the house
and the Phantom
yesterday we had full house before we arrived at the fountain
you won't have it after we dealt with this minibuses
so we are going to get that started
getting destroyed
we like the body of death the body of disease
meaning for the enemies
I mean it goes with the name really the clue is indeed in the name badge of death Dudley
never was anticipating not having full health
Amazon he went in a minute
surprisingly well
things did not die I was expecting things to die Houston me
but I didn't
weak damage reduction plus 12% or week duration earwig eration
make the week 10% longer
I would never use
play the weekend Somerset number as well
no point increasing the week and not the weekend
no we don't we are taking damage this is expected behaviour
especially when we don't have the Athena Dash
and therefore can't deflect things
and I was a waste of a good shot
apparently I killed them just in time to waste my
clip
aquilo
anywhere
is there a box there are no bots allowed
what shall not be allowed to remain
I have a problem pottery now have nectar
nectar
this is supposed to be easier in counter hello

is very good at writing
KSP Israel
in this situation he is wrong
no I'm saying you've noticed
yeah no worries mate enjoy the lyric
yes I'm asking Trisha
how to write how you doing buddy
you were sleeping
I'm not sleeping this is good
there is chaos and we have full house
there is a deadly and how would it chaos it is
how do you sleep when you're awake
correct
KSP should know better
guess we should absolutely no better
yeah will take the lunge
and the darkness
gold star riot
you can't have a gold star and arrive
that's not how this works
if you write you don't get a gold star
is not writing class
you don't get bonus points for doing homework practice
if you want writing class that's the extra magicka stream
she runs class we don't
there's no class around here
I really wish these little charity that could go away
did I see cookies
also extra matrica eating cookies that were provided by Kiki
I mean cookies are good
and this is interesting normally we come here because we want the
bestify to be replenished
even one of them
writing classes in extra atrica string
we don't need that
that would be awesome
so good that
60% bonus damages solid
30% life restore purchase number is even more solid
and that's fine that's 10
and Chambers were thieves
we want to take the Boom again or do on the second pump
I think we're gonna take the moon
even though it's a mini box which means it's going to hurt more
vitamin E W Wright
yeah it is less fun
unless helpful
if I can spend all day dealing with the ads
and they're not there with the boss
or I can do with the boss and then have loads of ads to do with afterwards
and the boss if you don't deal with a quick-release there is more and more butterflies I
butterflies are annoying
can you go
none of that regeneration stuff thank you very much
for you
the northern regions going on here
oh hello
yes please that's a solid boom
I have a solid boom
I can do some more speed as well
because who doesn't like moorespeed
oh night see that's not been immediately working
charming as well as putting them
whatever else it was
there's a lot going on here
because you don't know Hades welcome to insanity in hell
that is cool
that is also cool
that is useful
I think actually I want ibison
which is kind of bored because normally you take the rare one
shopping
definitely shopping
now we could fight and get the car again but I don't really feel like that's a good idea
are we going into wasp no no
in that case will take the Boom
if you're going into the boss fight I would be too
but we aren't so I'm not
reduce damage from foes yes and hopefully it's not too terrible
I would I would say it's good but meetings and have a good so
at the very definition of a meeting is eternal something good
if it wasn't for the party
thank you very much I'm going to need some of that luck
oh no it's not
and I have a New Era generation lot going on
sorry appointment in therapy appointment
yeah that's not a meeting that's an appointment that's very different
is a sliding scale with these things and trust me meetings at the bottom end of the scale
this is the way
sponsor don't see any
no fishing
something's are indeed at the moment scared fun yes
that is very much true
that was silly
that was that was very definitely silly
what I want is the Artemis one again not give you the extra Arrows cause of sleeping hours are epic
Artemis's Arrows that speak whenever you hit something
epic thing to have
who is the truth with money in it and we're about to go into a shop
I think having money when we go into a shop is a very good idea
I think we'll take that
the Chariots of not fire
another hundred gold always good for going into a shop with
shuffle hammer
I should with my lack of health
mama would be lovely but we can't take on PCs without full health
I can't afford both of these
spoon would be good
we have got three best device
we won't get them back in the next area
it's gonna have to leave the house
just because of survival
5-minutes the stream Raiders as well make sure you get some interest a lot
stay with the serious first as usual
he is annoying and has a big hammer
and needs to be put back in his place
we're not using I got go to you because the epic god games that we go from charging up is incredibly handy for
it's incredibly handy for using against three seaters
hard2hurt
what will these shield that gets in the way of everything
sorry want to chat the good gauge on a serious
what is almost fully charged now it is
SIG Artemis and Theseus
finish off in both
I know we can just burn Theseus down bit-by-bit
exit she's got a shield which is annoying
I will hit him as hard as we can
how many times we can
I'm feeling good about this
I think decidedly good about this run
unfortunately it's not a new weapon
so
will do it but
the new weapon so we still got for more weapons that we haven't completed with yet
McDonald's help us a lot
I got the one red Shady that supports us every time
all the other support Theseus and
no it doesn't open
he says that every time
yeah I'll take an upgrading rarity on the next moon
into the temple
into the Temple as usual
the more money
we like a bit of money
and we have got an idea but that will come
did I see a fishing spot I did not
I did see a date for the summer
very definitely a valid option
you want to go for this
I trying to avoid being poisoned
like that
unfortunately didn't avoid being poisoned
rather hard
that's ok we can make it
is little rats I rather quickly which is good
I need to kill them as fast as possible
I want to kill everything as fast as possible really but especially the little rats
give me the health advert
and that is 3 m
no that's fine ting that's not a fountain
everytime I try and go to that phone's I get hit for at least 20 if not 40
that is not pleasant
Thomas was just taking the boys and damage instead
oh yeah there we go testify
annoying I wasn't planning on losing a life in this area
damn rats and Poison
ok what's the hammer going to work for us
yeah double attack hit but not knocking back we can take that
it's gonna be a bit hectic because they're not gonna be not back
but we can do without think
we got enough money for some more House
I'm gonna get back in for another run
I feel like the help will be a sensible choice for dancer minibus as well
I meant never a sensible choice
you want the house
Halfords
no one done quickly
and I know he lost her not back now but
things are going down relatively fast which is good
double hit Elsa
yeah into watch The Saturdays
always solid
extra money for good measure
not too terrible
we still got three lives at the end
what's the more money there
theoretically we don't need to enter any other Chambers we can
go in there if you wanted more money
haven't got enough money for any of the staff
it's whether we want to lose health
I don't three More Chambers
I think the answer is we want to do a Street Motors
afterwards
so we have 25 hours on the field
on the go with high ground spell for ranged damage
2 kills each should just about do the job
24-hours 51 animes
I reckon we got this
I reckon we definitely got this
it's looking good so far
I think we doing alright on this
got covered we have indeed got it covered
you're awful taking her skills of 19
taking the top spot but we got an extra metricas stealing nose my sister way
in getting a trifecta guarantee in the rules got a random extra m picks up the goldgenie picks up a berserker and Skyland picks up the monks congratulations to all of you and wherever else
personal chests good look for those enjoy the sound goes on
stop everything on your reward tracks reward tracker in
I got a question on Gumtree UK
it's time for the toads
the toads are annoying
symmetrical
let's throw my warrior down again
what about here I think
the worm first and then that way
so where you get those units on it we've got half an hour until that comes up again
until then it's back in and I think this is going to make it that we're not going to take
Annalise
we're not gonna take anything
will get you a straight talking to service
cerberus stuffed
oh dear
ladies is not gonna be happy
ladies going to decide to be grumpy
we know this is the way
we know it's going to happen
ok
oh no that's not very fair
he's not very happy
and is burning his cloak again
right back a where
I have got most of the gods on my side now
love me we gonna do this easily but we got most of God on Our Side which will help
hello is learn a new trick he learned a big shield thing
is Blade Rift or coming hand lever
no he's gone involved in doorable again
quite likes doing that is rather annoying
how many days
you didn't teach me that I was going to be attacked like this
and using a shield of just ridiculous
Maria is halftime
yep
and again
I'll come along
this is a solid DPS build
weather in Planet damage your doing double hits
that's fighting for
that is never a wise place to be
I reckon we can do this
I think it's looking tight
oh come on
getting me through the post is not acceptable
are burning down now he's there
we had a minion
take me to work but we got there
satisfied
why would why would it be satisfied
that's good
best time is 32 minutes not 35 but ok
we got a new record 41
1 on 8 gauge
you got some seriously good stuff in that setup
yes Titan blood
and we go
are we going need
through the whatever
LEGO Jimmy where in Greece
we have made it to Greece
well it's a little bit more complicated than that you see
I think I'm a mistake
uniprix match
no
we're getting there getting through slowly
wake up
go on you can have another Alexa
nope
Caroline station
taking do Zafira a drink
isn't that sweet
oh dear
honey at the Nexus
that is an excellent question
yeah probably
let's give service another one
say that
there's a lot of story in this game it is excellent
oh dear office looks upset
stream of it first
no you can get upset with us
espresso
giving out all the Nexus today
oh dear
you're getting grumpy now
now go to the chef and hand in the fish
and get some keys
he's are not much used to us so we can trade them in for nectar
1 Titan blood for a diamond
I'm in the Diamond too good
but I don't think they're worth
Titan blood
victory the ambrosia for Titan blood which actually use worthwhile
because my not using the ambrosia at the moment
how much have we got we got 5 of it
Tesco Five Titan blood now
make an actual turn ambrosia into diamonds
Blood Diamond
yeah let's do that
will it show on the Old diamonds
and we can use them to get gemstones
or do we wait
and maybe spend the diamonds on
something else
I think will take the germs
can we afford an MB no we can't
buy some more stuff
Hades in our happy Boston redecorating is he
excellent we can actually play you
I didn't realise we could kick off the actual music
that's quite cool
I didn't realise it was basically jukebox
without a 3000 - 4 that I don't think we've done a morally snowy haven't
asking upsetting having loud music on
oh good is the run
what I should actually do
you should have a look at this
we can afford to unlock a couple of these upgrades
ok and level-1 actually upgrade it by 10%
special damage Rangers speed ok
I didn't realise what you get full on upgrade with this
I don't tend to use a special that much though
so let's just keep it as it is
we're not created that all the way
that's upgrade this one
to the first area
no I don't need anything I might get a just not done escape with this yet
beating Elysium but not beating Hades
so let's see if we can do a full run with the spear
that would be nice wouldn't it
who was gonna give us
let's have a look and see what's what
attacking it's chain lightning yes please
chain lightning is always good
especially when you get units that are in close proximity which These Arms
but I'm sure there will be soon
like that
slowly improving
glad to hear it
dash damage you solid
at this stage we're so early on that life offers the one to take
because at this point we get a lot of life up from that
there is a cows getting that gate there
yeah will take it
at this level will definitely take it
ok as give us
adoption
this weapon I pretty much exclusively use attack I don't use some special too much because it's a bit annoying
I guess I can force myself to use special the 3 and Countess
because otherwise of that one well we
no actually because we're going to do a long run with this and it's early on
so we'll take that we won't know what's in any of these rooms
dark as usual
there's no difficult choices
we found a shop
an efficient point
do the fishing
too early
silly me
yes Artemis
of course not
yes will have the Ultimate call again
the only time I wouldn't take the answer my school right now as if I had the option for the
hours every time you get anything
The Seeking hours have been better
the ultimate called is solid
I got this boss
sponsored exist solely to annoy me
and runs away the whole time
yeah ok Harris
13% bonus damage on everything
Will Take That
somatic cell dental health regeneron and a fountain for topping out
I don't know what we're going from here
and now be able to see what we going up to again
money yes please
I'll take the bonus cash money
will you die
100 gold
and the spoon
like lightning strikes lightning strikes good
hurrah
what is this gonna give us this time
oh nice jolted on chain lightning that'll be good
outlining and jolted
I cannot meet in central Asia but no
I want the money more ok we're going to survive x s
pictures for a grumpy today
yeah this is going to be a solid damaging
the jolt of the chain lightning
this is only going to end one way
lots of death
stream Raiders will take care of that in just a sec
I say just a sec another 10 seconds or so
inconvenience studying
we got we have 35 hours on the field
with my rainfall units so yes we got plenty range spell this
let's get it going
what agency
jumping up there extra metric and knocking him off the top spot
TSB briefly taken at top sort for a short time but getting knocked off again by extra metrico who is on a roll this time
she is absolutely role in this battle her way
is anybody else going to knock her off any of those spots
the giant Iron Man indeed
taking all those spots so far
let me take one kill the Knockerdown though
but it's not going to happen
7 assists I can buy in 16
extra mature cat taking all those rewards do you want a healer scroll or do you want Heelys grow
Hela Hela
very difficult decision I know
very difficult decision indeed I can get auto DJ to roll the dice if you like
command (very difficult decision indeed i can get auto dj to roll the dice if you like), ele0 (Not today), ele1 (can,you)
apparently not today
cheeky sod
you'd like the less Heelys got the less he the scroll is yours
I didn't realise that we're going to be sassy outrageous behaviour KSP katsiaryna School
and of course leads personal chests
so we're going straight back in front of the one we got that skin just coming up to
what have I got to do I still get units to level 20
I think we're going to just keep posting this warrior up sticking right over there KSP did Hindi programs us
that was an unexpected feature I was not aware that existed
apparently it does

Adidas
I'm not having this behaviour
aqua coat
occasionally we get to sassy responses but normally does he stop
people take the shop
no definitely wasn't me I didn't do it honest
yeah will take the cheap Boon
do that
the true shot is a very solid thing to have here
boost this one up
yeah let's bustier chain lightning
and take some health
and then going deal with one of the Furies
lady murder
meggy murder
I'll check out all the parts make sure there's no room
money in any of them
close the walls in Arnos
has she gone
and the walls are closing in
I shouldn't like that very much
she did not like that at all
recall that result
or definitely call that result
if it won't work all that is a winner
me going back to the house for the rest of the run because the health is
SKS results
ok office
now he's not got out with us Peter yet so
I had chaos what does chaos want
24 life
Elsa hamilo
I mean hammer School but I think it'd be rude not to take chaos especially with full health
but I looked at the Hamilton's
we always take care I'll take the Hammer
unless try not to die too much of the love
lotteries rather painful and needs to not be
what a week
the tightest rapidly yes I think so
especially because of short the deals 50 base damage in an area
yes definitely
oh definitely take that is a solid
very solid option
the correct choice
that happens
is basically free lightning
yeah that was definitely the right decision
and we can have Hermes
I going to house house
yes that'll do nicely
I think that was very definitely a wise decision
animal burritos in pots
what are we saying and we have a shop
we have Artemis
anime shop
I want to take us but we're going to take the shop instead
no we haven't got a lot of money but the darkness is good
can we get Aphrodite anyway
which is always a solid option
does plenty of damage
that works
KSP no worries

he was very rude to us
we asked him to roll the dice in his answer was not today
cheeky sod
very cheeky indeed
not very impressed
I'm really impressed yeah
what do we have
must know it's definitely a delivery coding thing
staff damage yeah will take some of that
unfortunately you can't get away with must be a glitch because you know that I know that your code is infallible usually
when you quote something you can be intentionally
you don't get away with that
we're doing a high damage run with some chain lightning
Joel 2 defects that cause all kinds of Mayhem
what's a rapid attack
we have completed One run tonight with the Shield again
am I confident sinew is based on fact
right coding you deploy it you
because it doesn't work you take it down fix it and then put it back up again
I think I want the max health even though the shop is a
adoption
the Mac self is the good option to take
and this might that should be maxhealth yes we have to fight
didn't matter which way I went there I was going to end up in the same place
you're not wrong
always good
the character is always good
wonder if I was misbehaving a bit
stuck in it
1 seconds
earphone with the classics neither can fall into my ear or
disappear somewhere
it looks like the tip is disintegrating I may have to pick up some Oreo tips at some point for these
I'm not using my molded wonder the moment I've used them for other things putting the studio I've got another pair I use and they take universal a tip so I can get some more tips for them and I'll be fine
what is bitrate
glenburn hydra
then you still grumpy
yeah he still grumpy
I haven't got a deflect so need to be careful all these things are kicking out me
I say careful what I mean is I've just got it
you pissing them and hoping for the best
he's down
yeah that shine lightning is very damaging
ok yeah that works
it's no wonder that normally kills him
I would like 6 attacks
ok yeah that's definitely a solid build so far and it's only get more solid as we go
only good get more solid
all we need is a few more Boons which will come
with future Chambers
ring good in the shop
no
how are you doing tonight anyway k-speed you enjoy your burger really

shout-out for Wycombe on there we go
you haven't checked out week then I don't know where you are and who are this week's is well known on this channel
one of the children earlier completed that one so that's 3 wins now
Two weapons I want to win with every weapon
I need all 6 weapons to win
and yeah we only had two two different weapons so far
I already had a hammer this run and I don't think we're going to get a space monkey how you doing
courtesy
back again back to cause trouble
this is a solid build this timely
your chain lightning we got jolted
and we've got the
hold to rap it's beer
from the date in the summer
I think we got a decent build
when you look at that is some serious damage being turned out
so far
Cape looks busy on work I didn't know we had a capon
it really wants to take it out the cinema
two chambers in a row whereas after this one
take it then
sent it off so nicely or didn't
when the hammer is normally my default approach
what do you mean no capes
I thought capes were thing
that's how you do with the butterflies
anything I don't like year of the goat for the Shields
today ever do the guest country thing I did not
ok so if I take the trip
does that mean I get 3 attacks
and I still get the fury flurry job as well
so I can basically have
is that how this works because it doesn't say it replaces
so do I get a triple flurry
if I take this
it should start ok
I think we're going to take that then that is a solid option left test that
oh wow yes
I can see this being very dangerous especially with the
rest of our stuff
yeah this is going to be a dangerous run
that's a nice Karen
well it's not annoying by Nikki his money cos that be a stupid thing to do
my boss up next
we can afford all three of these
damage has a chance to be crit and I'm dealing a lot of damage
what's your take all those cos why not
and with all that matters or 6 mini boss
normally I'd say take the pump for
yeah this is working very well
ok yeah this is not overpowered
this is now an excellent run
very excellent impact
effective clothes and more separate
Morrisons damaged didn't give me week already
yes that's good week
yes I could have more set the damage after dashing
alright evidently revenge damaging revenge damages Solid 1
week on everything
yeah ok
this is shaping up to be a very damaging room
the chaos Gate
yeah he's not lasting long
suppose you don't know the game Hades is little bit crazy and
you can all things Beatle bosses and go fishing
biggest fishing
destroy all the parts just in case yourself
what take this guy
is going to War for us
justify back
we got to him earlier work and we didn't need to replenish the death Defy
we already had the daft define
recovering
has given another nectar
cheeky welcome back for your meeting
weak turned up and brought friends with him
yes it is nice he brought friends
your coffee with delivered that is fantastic news that's not just good news
that is fantastic news
yeah we have to do last time
definitely take another test if I reply slow
especially the child of the gods on offer
the whole of chat is indeed grateful for the delivery person
nobody should ever be denied coffee
been tonight coffee is offensive at best
take
damage reduction or
we contest damage reduction
it's an offence of the coffee delivery person didn't deliver on time
when running out of coffee and sometimes unavoidable his coffee needs to be consumed
what is the coffee doesn't turn up on time
I think these due to need their shoes to be confiscated
yeah ok that triple triple Spear rapid shot is working well
they live on the settee with from the screen
and you don't have any emergency backup coffee
yes will take Curse of Vengeance
what have we got in this shop
instant life
treasure
two money fight
you found a complaint goes out of create your brain good plan
also filed a complaint against whoever your boss is for making you require so much coffee
comparing that much coffee should not be allowed either
not because coffee is not good
because nobody should require and have coffee but then run out
what is wonderful I'll bring your boss's boss then overs in charge of these meetings you keep having to attend
we're going to get offered we can get on some Darkness
Kiki the real Troublemaker surely not cheeky wouldn't talk cause trouble
but only if you ask nicely
Marion
shop and we've not got off 3000 Darkness we required
that's convenient apart with some money and it's in the shop
go onto the boss fight
is trying to hook up with his daughter
study on
oh hello yes that'll work nicely
but then so would storm lightning
this is now a tough decision
this is a very tough decision
lightning strikes every second I don't collect my spell things
or an extra for trainline
I think for chain lightning balances the solid one here even though that you were burning look pretty cool
no back-to-back to these guys again
he's not very happy
stampy cat doing things on yourself that's not necessary
damages after us now
death of I was kind of inevitable
John CC Estonia
maybe maybe not
except
Howick 0ri
wake wake wake honestly
that sounds like a band that was wet wet wet
anyway hope we stream the deal with four I get kicked out my own stream
so let's take a look at this what have we got
we have 53 Amazon the Field of this is a stocking number let's have a melee spell right about here because I can see quite a lot of killing going on in this area here
that just there let's get it going
this is going to be mayhem I imagine
story of Wick
it might be fun for Meg
refund for other people but it might be fun for Meg
bopping the DS
I mean that was kind of foregone conclusion really there wasn't there was not a lot of chance of that not going well but I thought that the most kills with 12 and the overall combined with 17 vengeful OG denying that most assists by taking those five
salice Rose going out at random people space monkey gets couple Circus extra m b 50 gold I get berserker KSP get to berserker and everybody else gets 7 Gold
of course those personal chest and this is the one you've all been waiting for all this is the loyalty skin chest the most dangerous getting Challenge level very hard for schools
course you get the chance to earn skins that are worth real money
so this is what you want to be in on this one
you need to win it and we're going into it right now so get down on the field will see that in about half an hour's time till they know hopefully we're going to do some more killing in the meantime
in hooks
a lot of health
we've had a couple of dates
which we haven't got 4 lives anymore
I got a feeling we might still be alright
we're not sending money there
Adecco Milano
I mean this is a very dangerous looking
attacks that we still got three lives
I won't take that just yet because there's a chance as my some money up here
that's not with the money
just spam that
I love more money
haven't surprisingly well
this chain lightning is ridiculous
ridiculously good
ridiculous
and with a spear I can't even avoid the rats
and their poison
until I jump into it to go and deal with the other thing
I have a good feeling about this
no that supposed invent
atlas good
that'll do that'll do nicely
we lost a lot of health there
we did a lot of damage and what time we going to fight Hades we are going to have
a bunch more stuff
I don't really want to lose one with the hammer effects that we've gone
even though we could potentially get two really good ones auto really terrible ones
plastic bugs the bins
hello
yes
that was a solid burn to take
that's the one we want off you cast hit with attack or special for eggs seeking arrow yes please
that was exactly the boon that we've been after
because health
oh no this is ridiculous run
I think people are going to be disappointed if I don't make it at the end with this run
no I won't take that
you would have done I didn't see anything that was really worthwhile taking
and actually I quite like to take one of the bombs
has it got two Poms therefore double
damage
have is always nice yeah but we got upon for double damage waiting for us to get back if we don't spend the money
but it's going to cost us 300 so we need to make a bit more money
I need to find some health quickly are not helpful either one of them
burrito
and not stand on the x
that was a rookie mistake
everybody standards
what
and it's all going down the pan in one quick movement
it's all going horribly wrong
we just lost all the digestive ice
I don't believe there's a way we can get them back
not here
escape the pump
the 16% damage reduced
let's see what her visit got for us
I can't afford to die
I really take much more damage at all at this point
we have no data files this is not boding well for fighting It's Ladies
and we're on such a good one as well
lots of more money there
I don't know we'll see another 200
Mr XP welcome thank you so much for that follow great to see you how you doing
tonight
hope all is going well it's good to see
excellent
yes a sack of some of it
yeah definitely hot
I'll take the extra Dash
Anna coffee break the pot breaking the box is a requirement
how to get phone out the phantom anyway but breaking the boss is a requirement
that is actually not giving me full health which is unusual normally think of something Max
ok we haven't got enough money for anything in the shop
Atkinson Nexa
we're getting him upgraded slow and slow
all three attentions thinking what to eat more case we ordered a burger earlier
a very solid shaft
not really
I can't imagine it's going well we have no dr5 and Hades is a tricky customer
but we're going to give you go anyway because I see anything we can do in the situation is getting there and chlorine as best we can
so will give that a go
I'm sure he is getting fed up with this now
that's not very polite Mr ladies
you need to hate you
again with the burning Clark has he got a cupboard for the clocks
where's he going to come from
over there
I was not very pleasant
are you letting us passed
yeah this is not going well
I didn't go to toilet while keeping and gainfully employed
went to heaven
that was a shame that was going so well to begin with
we had a solid run until we went into therein lost all identified
losing the desk device that causes problems
ohno software developers definitely end up in hell
I've been working in support long enough to know that's where they end up
I'll be around here right now
it's listed broken
at the dog
maybe didn't like that we put a cushion down for the dog to sit on
you did not like that at all
I do like this game for it story
lots of story in this game
it's going to be inspirational and administrative chamber
inspiration
survey
I'm not sure that sort is called
x all the things
we got to spend these gems eventually so we may suspend the Mumbai in other things
and we can't afford any ok
we spent all of our gems
I haven't got enough Diamonds anymore
or if you want
and it's a thing
they're not bad
I got another fish
get here
bloodborne ambrosia no
known
definitely not
meaning of need lots of tiny blood at some point
that what we got first
mobility Dubai in the fete persuasion
I mean another 4000
the next one
let's find out what weapon it wants to take this time
are the Shield ronica
shield run is always a good choice
I'm going to carry on ranking up
this bracelet
it's going to want us to have something on the packaging
let's put damage control hello night because we've
I don't like any of these emotions
a bit nasty
I could do that
I could knock Matt down
actually
no I don't need that
definitely don't need that
I can do that one and that one
give us the right amount
that I should be able to deal with we'll see how this goes
one new possibility can't be the end of the world cat
Dionysus cheeky
attacking flicks hangover yes
and I'll get straight in
chaos right at the start on a chaos right at the start is usually good shout
lots of money out of that
not the end of the world
where will it take me
oh yes please 74 bonus life
definitely
from Darkness to regenerates about hell that we used
74 bonus life is not to be sniffed at
Anna hammer what's the hammer give us this time
stick with us to find out
money pot
I totally how you doing
today's protests was preempted by me streaming
why you no
I did say on discord earlier that we would be streaming anyway
because whilst I think it's great the people are doing what they believe is right
I personally don't think it's going to leave anything and it's better for me to stream anyway
because I think that not streaming would just
more than anything else
Adidas track deals 50%
Terraria yes please
serious
every have their reasons what they do I have my reasons why do
and I fully support people doing what they want to do
Mercury and other decisions to make
oh good we got
apparently
people isn't very nice
on duty either way yeah
for the most part not been behaving well
High Wycombe and mayonnaise but you know other than that it was been well behaved
one random boon becomes common then games rarity every 3 encounters
I could be good if it picks one that's already not far off Common
yeah Let's Take That
that speaks drunken strike or drunken strike in slang
epic or legendary
another Wickes just wrong what I would dream of saying it
I wouldn't dream of saying it either
which exact for a test I suspect he's talking about the twitch protest
I could really do with a god Gate ability at some point haven't got one of them yet
ordering food
we mentioned it was mostly behaving exactly you mentioned mayonnaise at one point
does an unsolicited mention of mayonnaise in chat
yes play Drift
that's what I thought you were talking about toasty
that is what I thought you were talking about
I've got to stop standing on those spikes that's really not good for my health
what we got here
we have gemstones yes we like gemstones
Windows show up then hopefully
we'll get some information out of it the bottle log it and if it does show up then we can work on ways to stop them
but to do that we need to find one and then then we need to log it
they do turn up
oh nice yes cos we got a bonus that gives us extra
gemstones
matchlocks angry toast
hey if you're interested in working on this as well you won't have a chat with KSP there was a long discussion in my chat channel earlier about
the way they're going and everything and you know
mechanisms and so on
no we weren't talking about hack toaster
there's no toasters involved in this
yes if you have a look in my chat channel from
a few hours ago on discord of course

you're not wrong there
I think anybody feels it's appropriate to organise a tredz
should absolutely not be around here
we got hangover and all the tack so yes we'll have that
we're not having any that rubbish going on here
I think this is looking ok so far as the run
we've done to escape for the Shield now though so
yeah what Take That
when a double boom is always a good chat
especially when followed by a shop
call Kiki
and if she's got enough work to do already
I'm not sure we need to make her more than direct to work today
not a new new fish
not seen that one before
hello
take the house
as over heel but will take it
going into a boss fight with a new ability on the boss
oh hello that is a new ability
that is definitely new ability
this is very definitely a new ability
so they're going to swap around then all the time mate ones
as well as formidable freedom surroundings
or maybe they are all when I was only once
stream Raiders
Zach seems to think it's not very sporting
wick on the other hand we know he'll be happy with this
Neymar Santos yes indeed Street Motors kicked off just as we started at battle so we're going to deal with that in just a moment
what can we chat with a great see
are you doing tonight
it is that time
beautiful alert just as you sent that message so welcome welcome and once more welcome x
how are you doing this evening we have 41 hours on the field this is a decent number
what we got we got two small pumps we've got one large clump the large clump yes the best results from the smell what are we going to do we have lots of ranged units we have lots of melee units
I think we're going to boost the ranged unit system
drop that what about there we 41 hours on the field let's get it going
48 hours 1 to 1 kg in a few space this shouldn't be too difficult I'm sure we got this enhance
and even
we're getting out of those tools very quickly
you taking two of them though
turn on the assistive begin with we'll see how this goes it is mate there is stuff going on
we are going to see what's happening
this is a massacre finger dying this is the way they need to be
things are going very quickly and some of our allies some of the enemies lots of dying overall
things are happening this is the way to do it yeah it's alright action magical we got this we've got this covered
super 14 hours late got 6 cm left
five enemies now I don't think we're going to have a problem with this
with my skills at the moment and the talkSPORT but is anybody knocker off
KSP sitting there with the assistance he can get knocked down
what happened
healthier sis spot
Gonna Last
it is going to stick like that extra m k text the most kills 10 and the overall combined total of 14 at the top spot clowns called I taking the most assists with 69 efecto
always likes you know the rules if anybody
almost at my sister guarantee reward
random in this case 200 don't extra metre
everything's going out gold each life insurance for me and best of luck he knows personal loyalty skin chests
if you get any skins do let us know in chat and of course don't forget to claim your quest rewards if you don't claim the rewards you don't get them
go and clean them otherwise you won't get the reward you won't get the next Quest
navigate straight back in on the toads
Let the Sun started see what we've got
working on getting this warrior up to level 20
through the wire down right there
alright bye this large clump of enemies that need to be killed
because they do need to be killed
we have half an hour for that I'm going to quickly check out the shop as well and see what Scrolls we've got in the scroll shop
we can do a rogue upgrade was up
we can take Barbarian
upgradable and pasta
mechanical berserker upgradable
can we take the paladin up we can get another 7
yes we can we can upgrade the other day with that we got any go to do it
anyway so will take that and well
a penny in for a pound take the three monks
taking everything else out the shop
switch the rogue Barbarian
that was very profitable shop run today and of course the power of them
as well
quickly keep driving those Scrolls my place in those units on the battlefield
so we'll see that in 28 minutes 51 seconds
how you feeling
I think these feelings on their praises underfed easily by saying no
the house will you go back to my health drink it because
and I over use it but I like the owner self what have we got in the shop
none of that is worth the small amount of money we have
that is very definitely one way to put it
got right now is a burrito which we don't need because we got full house
so let us grab some gems
get this battle going
I take out somebody's enemies
I knew there was going to be new ability I didn't realise the inability was going to be all three sisters at once
and that certainly in ability
Zeus lightning strike
and the chaos Gate
do I want to take a chaosgate
212 healthaid lose 24 of it
options I'd never poem
health upgrade
or we can see what chaos is an office
I think I actually want to see what else is going to offer us
it's going to hurt but I think we want to see what this gonna do
especially since we've now got the burrito charm back for restoring some of that health
what is Chaos going to give us
what is solid
7% more Darkness equal
doesn't more health
yeah I think we want that
we got Darkness here which won't give us a bonus because it's so soon
give us a bonus later on
my folks if you want you to the Channel you enjoy what you seem do feel free to give us a follow
greatly appreciated
we have just been off all our goal we will be doing a celebration stream soon
not sure what we can do to celebrate
do chocolate follow on that total there will be a new girl coming soon
I just need to remember to update it
which I might do my distributors next actually
I do feel free and throw following if you haven't done already and you enjoy what you seeing
especially didn't you might want to come back again in the future
if you don't know what's going on feel free to ask
we're not an education stream but we are streaming like to explain what's going on
and Hades is a particularly managed game
I right now and destroyed all the parts because the boxing to be destroyed so that
check with no help hiding them
no there will not be a 36 hour stream
battle not be happening
3.6 hours maybe
3.6 hours we could possibly do
no definitely not space monkey Daphne not
papa would be handy but the gems I think
I think it's got with gems
are we going straight into minibus
there will not be a 72-hour stream
oh dear
I just like these Gorgons they're annoying
lots of Coke I've got a box of 24 cans it would that do
open land you
oh that's a fated choice we should probably take that fated choice
I want to take strong drink but
I'll send you a solid choice as well COS with multiple enemies
hangover friction is a thing everytime I hit one of them
not so good on the boss fights but good for the standard encounters
and there are a lot of somebody kind just left to do
what I did want to check as well
we should have no yes drunken strike is now heroic
that is very solid that chaos been working incredibly well
I like the zoo special
lightning just slapping everything on the head
customer died where's the other one that hasn't died yet health
I'm trying to keep as many hit with hangover as I can
as long as three of them or effected we get that bonus
only 6 jams that was a bit of a
tight-fisted reward down there
I suppose all goes to I got no money for the shop when they're develop on
with that little money the shop is worthless except for being a free not fight
then this looks like a shop anyway
and is therefore a free not fight as well
I take the pump
yes I think I will take the juices aid increased
oh yes when we get all the diamond for completing this because we're running it with a harder
level of pact of punishment
we have changed his name to learning rather than learning bernhardt-roth
whether he likes it or not I don't know but that is new name at the top there
whether we like it or not his own choice
I don't really care if he likes it that's what he's getting
I'll get the blade ripped on the go again
this is very unhealthy run with taking a lot of damage but at the same time
so the animus
navigate learning is down
lonely does not like being
trumping and dead
but he has no choice
the snake is gone
what is the weight needs to be
take my house
he has not learned to no he hasn't
give me over here I don't need Overhill
not at this level
ok this is going to be entertaining
green is always green here
destroy all the parts
distinctly short on money so money is definitely what we want
ASDA chaos Gates we probably won't take that depends on how it helps we have when we get to the end
that was wasteful my pick-up burrito with far too little health
should have saved it until we don't least 10 health left
early space for ten health
is only getting 4 from you stupid
I can't want another health swords run at some point because that was phenomenally good luck with pick that up
I feel with all the extra upgrades we now got the health sword would be overpowered as anything
you don't know the health sort every hit you do you gain something like to help back you have a low health total
regain to health for hit
and that is ridiculously over powerful with the amount of hits that we do 1 things
the Daedalus hammer upgrade for the sword so
random channels you get around where the sword is the bonus weapon anyway and then it's more random chance with you get the Hammer
and if you do get the hammer whether or not you get the hammer upgrade the give you the health sword
1 in
something chance
or whatever the game Theory says
I'll take that 75 gold
how or burn
myHermes is very good on the Old bone front
we can never have too much health
I feel this is a policy that needs to be followed
can never have too much health
especially when one stands in traps and takes 15 damage from a trap explosion
feels like this is always a good policy is when in doubt health
that was going to regenerate we're not having any of that
so that one not again not having that
don't stand by the traps there bad for you
all good what did the chaos moon give me
yes
everything
that's not a cool but no
we can deal with flying whales
the shop awesome Nexa
if we don't take the shop I guess the next is going to have a health well in it
are we got 290 money
lots of money
and a spare burrito
I was going to office
flying butterflies of a child to strict why study good
yes that will be very good
so what do we think then we think the health yes we do
we always thinks the house
and then some money
because we just spent it all
and when we spend all the money we need more
bear with us or we kill a few things please people
it's kind of a requirement is killing
now we up
is some more dad and niece
and a Daedalus hammer hello
what's the hammer going to offer a system
we don't use special that much we don't reusable rush over but having it charge up fast and might make it worth using a bit
so you got to use Phantom
yeah gemstone I think
I'm gemstones are a good shot here
that helps just yet
I'll take it when we been damaged a bit because we invariably will be that we don't know sometimes
that was coming
I've got to get that house
and they were the things like giving people Shields
Rhino Shield on my watch thank you very much
it is possibly the healthiest wrong we've ever had
did not need that that was wasted
I thought I could dash out from under it but apparently not
just wasn't quick enough
this weapon is very good for the Old dash strike
which involves both dashing and striking
enough
and I'm not using the name or anything
how many butterfly orbs
come on then you go there we go
I'll take that myself up
wow I don't think we've hit 300 help before
ok let's take this Encounter
we have all my best device
so we're not going to leave them we have all of our health so we're not going to need that
what's he going to offer assist time
well you know
will be strangers
we're just passing by
yeah I think 60% damage
especially going into a boss fight soon
is well worth it
and let's give him another nectar
the anti-doping committee
we don't need committees going on Friday
managing by committee as a terrible idea
not take the shop
yes ok that will be handy
all that would also be handy
you're getting all my committee well that's ok then
I think we'll have that one because we found a couple of times or you've not had full house going into boss fights and that's being irritating
speights
under serious
it is a boss fight
well you say that but we beaten you multiple times now
and I know you do not like it but if you keep fighting against me you will keep trying
you know totally being a mod toasty is very welcome to complicate things for evidence you know for investigation purposes and things
if he needs to investigate take evidence and document reasons for taking action
then I'm sure he's more than entitled to do so
Zeus power was seriously hard-hitting
Madeira heck of a lot of damage
and I remember why I like the greater call of Zeus
it basically involves clobbering them repeatedly with Lightning Bolts until they almost died
Poseidon helping him out then
and we got to testify in there
he got clobbered repeatedly by Zeus
I definitely have one shade there that's on our side
only one
nearly lost the testify but we're going back here quicker and quicker each time
Murray
more money please
they're not money possible break them anyway
I'm not having any of that
ok so we've got enough for a single pump
there is Titleist do that
MacGregor and anyway
let's take health Festival
answer money
an unnecessary pump not bomb sorry burrito
this is one where we have to get up close and personal and unfortunately the rattler poisonous quite spectacularly cos they're nasty like that
these channels are a bit nasty are full of ugly annoying enemies
25 words about this
we definitely meet up words about this
I do not like these spinning blades
because I do things like that with hers
I think
they shouldn't do that
that's not very polite
I haven't got back to flex so I can't knock them back over
but I can't take my flight up
and burrito
break the pots just in case
ok I got enough money to make a baboon
we'll have this
yeah go on then
as we know when we going for the final encounter we will have Max self because we'll pick up of the Phantom which willmax set regardless
let's get diagnosis to give us some more stuff
history Motors lipstick Kerala
let's have a look what have we got we have
27 Amazon the field
thank you to help spell going down this time
I think it's very quick and very easy let's get it done
2722 enemies a massacre
well hopefully
navigate me sure of course
Killin to do first
I think it's looking good so far
a little larger there on its own doing towards those toads
KFC's Archer
but it might not do too well against older
many accidents heading all the way up to that rock to go and kill that and get the ants out from under it
is todah now in the area
maniac 6 berserker Died with the Ants
surprising we got 7 hours 6 hours 7 enemies
the rock and another for it this is really tight
that toad is do some serious damage
can we keep this Archer alive long enough to knock down those hands
I got a couple of years left
the Musketeer and Archer
can we take out the stone on the Ants without dying
reliable ksbs Archer and extra metrikus healer Musketeer and Hila I think
I think about Heelys the lollipop is no the light source of light bearer
ok we'll see what happens here then
Archer and Musketeer a good take-out stone out
do enemies each
come on come on extra matrica saving the day they're KFC's are doing the damage as well
absolutely rocket KSP taking my skills of 18 and the overall talkSPORT Extra m taken up top assists with 5
macedon
in the cat doesn't get the chest it may be called captain Trust but it's not the couch chest
to go on at random
thanks Scrolls for evil space monkey we have three flag bearers for ksb 74
a barbarian Ramparts 15 units to rent in first yes you're boring was a little bit nuts there with
5 Gold including me and of course those personal chests
and captain the cat does not get the chest and it's not how this works
epic tiny frog warbeast skin
that's pretty cool
the diving on this one we're going to
bookworms
I still need warrior rank up the warrior is going
the war is going better than he is indeed captain
it's not his chest
we'll see that in half an hour
right now we can go and see diagnosis
I say we can see dinosaurs beat up some enemies first
just captain not captain the cat
captain is a cat
I have to clarify that it was him and not some other captain because there could be multiple captains right
and you don't want to be confusing captain the cat with a different captain that's not the cat
otherwise you might have confusion
well yes quite DJ the human
although some Might argue that the subscriptions also necessary
some may confuse me with things that are in a human
exactly
some may argue that I don't particularly human at times so you know that's a fair description
in fact is very widely known that prior to me having coffee in the morning I'm very definitely not human
about .1 more zombie
description
nobody knows nobody cares it's monkey
that will give me some bonus life now
I could do with some bonus life now
I can do lots of bonus life now
especially since we're going to go and fight he's in a sec
respond first because we can't do anything money
yes I can't do anything else money anymore anyway
that's not this one since every time
celebrity press not the heat out did you
hour going in again
is going to happen
is very grumpy this bloke
is always very grumpy
what is especially very grumpy today
I don't know what boiling love does
it seems to hurt
and that was a waste of a good spelt
I got a hangover
you didn't have any sources
we knew that was going to happen
why we came in here with multiple lives
we're getting down shortly
navigate
so we've got one life left
one life left
you could not attackers and stop us in the first place and then everyone will be happy
you know
I don't need to run from this I can stand behind the thing and not be hit by it
under the die any second now
right after you finish just being a bit nasty there we go
unexpected
we have enough health to do this
it's only going to take a couple more hits
we can make this work we just got a burning down quick
and I quick coming before it burns us to home
yeah that was close 40 health left but we got in bed
very much stress great see you hiding tonight
welcome back as things
who does he think he is Gandalf or something
I think we shall pass
I think we're very definitely shuttle.bus
only broken or playtime record as well very nice
I'll take that
we cannot quite sure what to say there oh no it's just a cheeky little taking time to load
quite pleased that not quite sub13 but
best time yet
and another time bruv
AJP how you doing
Zima
I seen early about a weapon I think you'd enjoy on this
if you haven't found it yet when you're fighting with the sword
Daedalus hammer upgrades basically give you to health every time you hit anything
so it does mean you end up with less overall Max health
Everton
you some serious
healing ability because every hit you make you get to health back for it
and you make a lot of hits
so it's kind of IP but
yes drinks before today's be good
you know been sitting with the back symptoms of tennis to 20 ish
stream
we've now beaten Hades twice today
particular for overall
things are going well all Things Considered
hey combust how you doing
welcome aboard
welcome to the Stream
you seen this before have you play Taylor Swift
ok so apologies for that if you were kind of
not sure what was going on
maybe just hope you know this is where you come it's time
that's great see you beautiful x as well ok that's funny because I've only just been in for my phone
so yeah
welcome
same cover you had which sauce excellent
I will go and check but it's well over 60 plus probably close to 65
we have done a lot of runs to get these for kills
but I'm not playing the God mode on I'm playing in normal mode and as we know I'm not exactly the best gamer on the planet so we play this for fun rather than for skill
55 runs ok you're a little bit early then all in
vs runs
then somebody says very much luck of the draw as well we had some terrible runs we had some great ones
come have a look 64 that we go
about 120 yeah that makes sense
companion
I haven't unlocked companions yet
so our best time is a shield run time of 30 minutes 35 seconds
the shades do not like it when your inspirational
I get very upset
you know what companion does that's why I keep myself again
Monica's on experiencing
yes service
Spot the Dog
0 out of 10 get rid of the game
thank you very much gave us greatly appreciate it
Anna's night but very carefully said that do come and join us on discord as well
great to see the Shield is very overpowered when you have the right Boons and abilities
I don't tend to use special hardly at all on most weapons
it doesn't it doesn't work the Shield about overpowered anyway you've just got to be willing to dash and smack a lot with it
it doesn't necessarily the need the dateless hammer bus
if you get the right other beans in other places that the Shield is overpowered and
pretty epic
now
some house improvements
blocking yeah blocking is not something I'm very good with
let's have some decor
mood lighting
he's going to tell us off now
oh yeah the bow is very powerful to get the right buttons as well
yeah each other weapons has got their own
ideal combos
let's give make some more drink
just doing jobs
by the way if any of you wondering what the blue bubbles has dancing around the screen
play Aerosmith
if you are on a desktop browser
opera safari or Edge
doesn't work with Firefox you will see as a ball bouncing around
what is representation of where I am looking in real time
so you'll sit dancing around only Leicester prices
and if you click on the extension configure in the top left of the stream window itself you can change your colleague and change the shape can change your plans of fun things
but that's one if you haven't seen it before
she's not very happy
why are you no Meg
yes service is officially the employee of the Month
st. James from the chef
we can change 10 gems into one nectar
I've had is a worthwhile right
and one of these will be finished 250g don't mind if I do
don't mind if I do it all ok
I need one more boom from Zeus
Aphrodite
one more from Hermes
Monmore from dermata
open gyms will come a lot more as you go through and unlock things so I haven't got any gym boost here I don't think
but what you will see is if I run back here
if you come to the house contractor
you can get things like
the upgrades
where is it
go down
you can get this upgrade that gives you 20% bonus gems
you're using the recommended
weapon over 1 give you dark first
getting to Inferno boosts
which give you more gems when you get
you can also get there's a couple more that give you boost as well
that one example for diamonds you get gems after beating any boss so that's going to be
Andy
whole bunch of things you can get the upgrade your ability to get gems
moc decor
Tobias Menzies as we can because a noise 80s
and be there's I think objectives for getting more
things purchased
navigo services and I got a ball to play with
is it the dogs going to do without the dogs gonna play with it
silly Hailey's honestly
what does he think that dogs can do with a ball what else would a dog do with a ball stupid
I don't know
please underworld gods honestly
right let's take this on upgraded Whitmore
no I don't need to be up there actually
cancel that yes indeed
you figure out who hides Kelly
well we don't need any this packed malarkey
turn all the lights off because we haven't completed it without get so weird
dealing with it being on
as diving
unlock the bottom once the bottom what
things on the mirror
come with time and keys
or do you mean the
think it's at the bottom of the trinket chest I'm not sure yet
yes I suspect keys
I suspect there keys you can't start using until you filled up all the other bits about them
ok so
oh yeah we'll have that deflect
Dacia flight is always the best Dash
if offered the dash deflect you take the dash to flag
every time
if you are at the start and tails here
not worth not taking chaos
I don't think there is a Persephone gift
if you mean the last if that's not unlocked
I was explain the US I have that explain to me last night
Persephone
it looks like it should be but it isn't
move speed but then health
yeah most Big Ben house
we discussed this last night I can tell you if you want based on what I was told yesterday
only if you want
it is not a squeaky toy from 270 that goes murder no
take the darkness because Darkness as we know his health
and healthy is a solid policy lol x
I don't have very many policies
OK that's fine
we won't spoil it then
and we're not running the
burritos
can I give you a sign
I tell you what game boss if you want to know shoot me a DM on discord happened to the discord server sent me a friend request
and then once I'm back on their later I'll accept it and I'll bring you a DM about it
also anybody else is not on the discord server do for you join everybody's welcome
would be great to have you all along
understanding to get the damage and I want this time
probably not but it's worth finding out
I do like the old fated prophecies they give me rewards
rewards are always entertaining
it's pronounced
going to this lot
excellent
I bet you can't make a bum with then I can make a plan out of anybody's name I just need to try harder
I'm not the only one
temperature is the cause of the snow yes
attacking flicks chill
yes
have we got enough in a mini minibus that'll be excellent
let's get straight in there on that one
I don't need to show you what I've got
all I need to do is ask my voice activated bot

there you go
news about cookies what kind of a bot is
the refund on the joke
I can't choose a favourite because in the rest of my hate me for the rest of the game and that is a problem
death defiance crystals more health than usual and restore one more
can you fit
don't be rude Jake
rude
see I don't wanna take that but I don't need to replenish identify right now
exposed duflex that'll do
is it stormy dash it does deflect anyway
no replenish doesn't it just feels up the existing hole if it was empty
otherwise it would say and give you one more or something or increase testifies by one
so I won't do that it will just fill up the ones that are empty
it's all in the wording
or chaos and one of the drink it's one of the training will give you an extra one
there is a trinket I believe they give you an actual anyway
which actually might not be a bad shout for let's run in the run
although to be honest I can't rely on the due to drink it for getting the health back that I need
is the house burritos are
absolutely important for Myra
with the last run ending with me on 4th health and no doubt if I is back
yes getting lucky tooth may be the one
let's take some health for health is always a solid policy
I want the Daedalus hammer I want to do a health soldier On
must be because I know absolutely phenomenal that weapon is
when I get data summer yet
the lucky tooth you get unique interaction with the god
yes there's different interactions you get with different gods anyway with different trinkets
if I had the
ratio I got a different Direction with the encounter of the braces came from or something
there's a whole lot in this story that
crazy
ok what's a true offer us
germs We Take That
oh yeah there's tons of unique dialogue isn't here
yes I mean I found a set of the works for me it would I use the first section basically to upgrade an existing
trinket I don't really care about that much
and then with the other ones I just use a juicer charm for the
drops
because there's burritos are
absolutely the most powerful thing for me
yeah everything is work you are really good at the game haha Davis hammer
let's see if we can get the health sword
it's probably not going to office that option now just to be difficult
I seem to remember being a rather awesome option
so they probably then either God based trinkets
is that they only basically fire for the first chamber
so that they're worthless
ok so it's not gonna give me what I wanted
that's annoying
that becomes a big shop but I'm using a tackle lot anyway next time it'll take that
steering damage
we got enough money for all these
what area can give us
I mean that's worthwhile because the bosses at the end of where we really need it
beginner take damage for everything
I'm going to take the palm
I'm going to take more damage
there's no point wasting 50 gold on the burrito and chips I really don't need that much
do this fight will do this
something went weird anyway will do this fight and then we'll get on with Street Motors
what happening something went very weird and everything sound a bit off
I have no idea why
she didn't last very long as she
didn't last very long at all
thank you very much going bust
it is time of course for stream Raiders
the part of game where you guys are in control of what happens
so we have
what we have we have 32 Amazon Mayfield we have a whole bunch of them down here that's have a defensive spell because I think we're gonna need it
B2 alloys a whole bunch of enemies
the easiest boss but at the same time she still hard when you first come to deal with at beginning of the game
so let's get this going 32 hours 38 enemies
you guys are in control of this life for a 1 unit at the start I throw 1 spode at the end
of the night it's all on you
deleuze is down to the unit you put in
and what we got here is looking ok somehow I got the most kills that's not right I should not have the most kills
this is not how it's supposed to work
I'm not supposed to have the most Kills at all
but apparently I did get the most Kills on the top spot
spy got the most assists
totally not how this is supposed to work
visible to going out a random
monkey picks up one Buster ksb pics of to Busters MK6 gold I get 15 and of course best of luck Windows personal chests
and don't forget when you finish the quest you need to go to the quest screen and turn it into get those rewards
15 articles not to be sniffed at
so that is the last of those battle for the night but we are going to run on for a few minutes more
you just eaten a good friend make
some cash
thank you so much for that fully
really appreciate it
definitely will be switching back to do suffer from this point onwards this is the way we do this runs
look at the shop because I want to save the money for later
we are the dive on through
yes indeed we did we hit the follower go yesterday
I need to increase it
we will get a new gold going will also get celebration done at some point so do hang around on discord and check that out as well because they will be celebrating going on
you do something silly like
play a random game on stream or you know last time we do the community game day
so I got a whole bunch of players from the community on the street together
we played
rocket League or something
but we played that
and we called some Mayhem
Attack of all happen at some point Wick
the thing that you and case we both forget is that the more I get pestered
to refuse
or ignore or just generally be difficult to wait
I play things in my time
so with wipes that won it
make an older parts
money
always
always always money
yeah no worries go-busters good to see you
I do late nights 032 0 on weeknights Tuesday Wednesday and then Saturday Sunday only wait till midnight
Assam around 4 nights a week there is a schedule channel
command here
check out those and it will tell you when we going to be on
I got all the good stuff
Linx the more you ask the longer it's going to take
this is the way
what take that win
take the max life
you don't play Talk of all have any interest in it well you know that's neither Here nor There
and we have a shop or a key but we have a fishing spot
stand in the fire
do the fishing that's not enough house don't worry I need more health than that
I need plenty more health and we've got
we only have 247 is not a lot of health
I can burn through that in no time
my policy is if there is help available
is almost always the right option
and a burrito
you take the moon
and we have policies to uphold on this channel health is always the correct policy and less possibly there's a Daedalus hammer or maybe a double-blind trial of the Gods
I could do with a call because I haven't got one yet so that will do nicely again that is a policy
if there is a call offered and you haven't got a call already nice I don't take next to that often that doesn't do a huge amount as far as I can tell in the game except increase your standing with the other people
it doesn't seem to be anyone here is important for my run certainly is health the hammer upgrades
the double boot options
I'm sure I'm doing it completely wrong but I don't find nectar to be all that useful
which is what just been giving away at random
Nexus 4 law that's great the other fossil level upgrade
you see how is your head right for it but a hammer vs a trial of the gods if you get the trial of the gods which gives you two bones for the price of one
that's often better than even the Hammer
that upgrades great but again you don't see that much nectar and run I think you'll see maybe 4 or 5
the whole lot possibly 6 or 7
and if you don't get that been offered until
is basically worthless
you know if you don't get the offer until right at the end
no point taking it
he said that as well
stemetil
what do I want to take
I think I should take less damage let's damages always of Ali auction
you may be drunk because also debitor

sf2 random upgraded
oh that'll do
hello
hello heroic positive outlook yes please
yeah so some of the stories that goes quicker than other parts
now look you
come back here
I missed this call ability is not the best call ability
does you have to be stood there right in the middle of the damage
the no call
that is another policy if you haven't got a call recorder better than no call
BT fastest time yes
ok
greater haste definitely

we're going to take on a good friend learner who's just changed his name and are screen
two or three encounters earlier
you will know to the top of the screen now his name isn't learney the bone hydra
hydra
which is Chronicle
learning not to be confused with Ernie
that was a waste of some spells but
yeah it's pretty cool
I'm going to finish this fight offer
see I think this guy is actually easier than some of the other bosses I think the Furious can be hard at times then learning is
especially if you have the bow because a special on the bow in here is absolutely devastating on his head in shreds them in seconds
yeah the special on the boat absolutely devastates
and that is how you do with honey
so let's take that burrito
let's head out to the next level
