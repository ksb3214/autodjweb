very good evening how you doing buddy
thank you so much for that 9 months of subscriptions with Prime
appreciated by keeping the train running
it's good to see you
happy Tuesday how are you tonight
I was going out with her
it is great to see
we are going to check out some stream Motors to kick off with
this is what we do this is the way we do things we going to start this battle
Reading Town that loyalty skin chest by the end of the night hopefully
do we have to do for quests we have blaze all slaves also as we can definitely place
there indeed
is an AUX lead
to let cedars unit going
I'll get some down on the battlefield
extra metrica how you doing great to see you here you are and here you look happy Tuesday
how's your day been so far
lurking work and I assume hopefully it's not going to badly
sniffing sneaking in like a sneaky ninja greatest eBay
work yes something like that it doesn't work so I'm going with looking at work
are we all doing now
hopefully you guys are all doing well
that is what you wanna see we wanna see people doing well
if you're not doing well then we got problems we need to address them
talking problems we have problems and frogs knackered but ok
extra mattress is very warm outside
A Smidge inconvenience and slightly unpleasant
talking convenient unpleasant we have assumed it's going to behave which it is there we go
some Hades
for some reason
some sound that way
never been tired think you're going to sleep since it's 22:30 that is understandable but if you need to get to sleep get asleep but if you want to look here you're more than welcome if you want to chat here you're more than welcome do whatever you need to do buddy
30 degrees C I hope you've got some air conditioning on
630 series to match
that is something I can examine
the narrator is a bit of a snarky one
the job argument with the narrator in this game because the narrator is a bit snappy
back in this place
because we did actually finish
having just beaten the first boss
a623 there but it's still on if it's only through the table
so yeah we are all children
we have Acer boots
we have a bonus Darkness we have
bonus dash strike damage
when a bonus fish spawn damage Hazel Baron how you doing
we have bonus gems and bonus Darkness
pause help for 79 percent bonus
yeah yeah totally understandable but I totally understand it's great to see here
60% more damage always nice
Aphrodite
and 6% of health items in broken bones
all useful things to have
we are going into
the second circle
dumb Tartarus
we're going to lava land
Ormond hospital
that's why we break those 6 cos there's a bonus 10 out there
fishing
so we can catch anything in fishing
probably missed it would try
that is not a catch
I did not catch that is
the crustacean indeed
that is a fish which we can give to head chef
in return for shiny things
so you get other shiny things like this one around here
it tells you about random things
so we're going to carry on through
we can help with cancer more health during his battles
we normally do
I don't think I've seen you skeleton before
I didn't like that very much
I must have seen your skeletons before
good he's dead
he is dead as well
oh good one of these
so we want to make sure we take as many as we can
I'm sure these are harder than my face before
please very definite order
myHermes
ok
Close drop things faster
actually is faster when you move faster move faster I think
everyone that Hast
just check whether there's any more health around
always always look for the house
because health bots are handy ok there's no fish you want around here there's gold as upon which is an upgrade all ok there's a deadlift
mama is always the choice
health and Chinese yes health Chinese both Valley things to pick hello hello
hello bruv
farmers has come back to Elvis
ok good I kill more than he has so far
this is definitely feeling like it's harder than previously
ok what we did that we got ourselves a hammer
we're going to have special straight up before additional photos or after blocking the phone in 20% move damage and move speed
I'm on the move speed
and some health thank you very much
greatly appreciated
so we're going to check for shiny things and health
does that actually hurt a score a lot which was not ideal
ok no shinies
we got a choice in taboo no we can get a pump
not a good health is good with understanding New Year
when you getting out
how many if you could have died that would be appreciated
he was very annoying he hits me then
multiple times in fax
nice guys really annoying
it is not going well at the Old health department
will definitely take the bhuna
ok define dash replace Hunter Dash
you search and candy flex well that is a better option
where's my froggy take care
we'll see you later
having attacked deflect would be nice but that deflect is also nice
I think actually no attack deflect
9% attack damage is going to be big
ok so we can only decide or we can do Aphrodite
have we got from so far
cartel
by the way it's going to a minibus
let's go this way
is attacked deflect potentially means that we can deal with the which is better
ok it's not the witches it's
it's big Gorgon
I'll come along
this is one rocking thing
what he didn't hit me then
I was outside of his hit range
I know what I was thinking so much damage if that was inside a sipp range
escape the Boom
yeah I think you'll find that she is indeed the best Ash in the game however
deflect an attack is also very useful for me
that's why I went out instead
what have we got here then
oh hello yes
faster good gauge definitely
and fishing
another Cross station
ok so have you got any help around here
fated yes indeed that's what I'm going for is I'm going for filling up any of the Fate of things I haven't got yet
if they're not the best abilities if there's a fated one or potentially take that anyway
are we gonna get for key this time
because I want to finish this much of the fighting stuff as I can
lucky you it doesn't require any fighting
and fainting
Ella that helps a lot
and a burrito even better
that was a very decent chambela
Darkness which will also be health
ok yep
I need to keep attacking on this
is there more tax I get in the better
oh good some health
deflect attack is good
20 flight that is excellent as well but
I'm taking the deflate attack because deflection
and Medusa can all the Gorgon rather can go into the fire
except that Gorgon
I know more shiny things no more health
orpington go
Darkness house there is a shop there is health
shop
definitely a shop
definitely definitely the shop
and hopefully
a burrito that means I don't have to buy
health
purchase anyway that's fine
I can't have the boon and the pump I think I want to do more than I want the bomb
oh nice
do we want attack and speed stronger in the first 10 seconds I think not I think we actually want the Bounty
anacostia on the darkness
that is a poop that was terrible but the rest of that was good
abalone with back again
the Shield is not very quick attack weapon
Alexa motor is a rather slow attack weapon
it's doing the damage but
ok then
back to learning
just keep him keep him hard
his brothers again now brothers are coming
there is actually technique for which of these you should take out first I do not know it there for my approaches to just hit which airport is closest
it will die
is actually easier than Meg
which is correct way to say but
I like learning possibly the least hard at the bosses
and I see that that was
it wasn't easy but it was exactly difficult
he died and he died fairly effectively
so annoyed if there was something there
because I didn't use
response
if I had two that would be annoying
play didn't I don't say how you doing
yeah he doesn't care Chas but he is very stationary
didn't need that else got to use anyway
oh that's annoying
that's annoying I was hoping there would be a
regain your
testify that's what I was hoping for
I don't want any of those
carry on
how you doing anyway this evening x
happy Tuesday
how are we
I'll see you again I didn't need to have their that's over the character of there should be a character event
before
I think I'm gonna go for another boon because more bones is more better
you're all good thanks happy Tuesday thank you very much
I'm glad your good cause good is the best way to be
KSP how you doing buddy
if that's the fly back yeah
that was silly I should not have done that
that was the wrong place to go
just a futsal good glad to hear it
I have the last little bit of another nice cherry beer
it is rather lovely
dog gates charges automatically
money every time I enter a chamber
I never seem to have enough money
god gauge charging automatically is very very useful
I think I need the money more though
definitely the anymore even that ever is going to tell me that was exactly the wrong pick another Daedalus hammer there
I'm actually that even more than I need the money
yeah we're going for the Hammer
excuse me
money was a good pick yeah money was a good pick for the moon definitely
because I'm always hoping that I can find myself
shops like this mini shop
I don't have 200 I need for the mini shop to get that if it comes on
ok
deals 50% damage yes definitely
and another face it
ok
next June has upgraded rarity chaosgate spoons I don't really want any of those
oh ok this is difficult
trial of the gods which is awesome vs health
I think trial of the gods is definitely worthwhile
is that a double moon
is a minibus body is a double moon
I think we do the trial of Gods
I think that is the option we pick
I don't know which was going to be worse so we'll pick Aphrodite cos she's on the left
hello ok
revenge damage or death blasted revenge damage because that will help with bosses as well
countdown Artemis countdown
don't worry you'll get you go as well
when somebody always gets upset when you pick their other
no good one of the charities has got armour
luckily not a chariot of fire
what is the only when you need them
happy days
I'll take that as well
no you wouldn't
cast 600c useful
chance always crit chance
free chances always a decent option
all good
Arsenal shop
minibus or a shop
to make life unnecessary hard for myself or unnecessarily easy for me
I wonder which one I'm going to pick there
what have I got after this ok I've got a minibus or I've got a normal in cat normal and cancerous fine
I'll see the thing I definitely want myself
which means I cannot want the normal health as well
go over the max but I'd rather take it then
just having not anymore
is my boss is the Bull and the bull is annoying
and will you justify where as this probably won't
I didn't need that burrito just yet but
we got it anyway
what have we got
no butterflies good
they just love the butterfly waltz
they are nuisance
excellent
I love you in the traps work in my favor as well it doesn't happen often
knocking the ceiling down doors
attract helping we not so often
nice that deflects working well
and I trap also working well
what do you want to do staff strike
chance roller I think crit chance is the best one
as much as we can
any else one around here
no fishing spots ok fine
I can have money or Max health
Max health I think because money is good but Max health is better
there's a silly shops in there which we don't want to sell him as a boy shot there as well
annoyingly we don't have the 200 cold so we still can't buy another testify if we need to
that's ok kiss
what have we actually got in this shop
crystal health game treasure
I prevent flamewheel photos from current accounts
I think they're a bit of a waste
listen Alpha
hola can a character events yes please
document definitely
that will get me back my testify
Lantern health
how is the data Phi
30% life 60% damage all users a testify
add an extra life
and I think it's got to be the health
Durban House to go for next
have you guys could kindly just died for me
another shop two milk or never gets any tea in the morning that is fine do not get between Izzy and 80
getting between easy and tea or coffee is a terrible thing to do
is required
milk is required
I totally in Dorset action
are you making tea in the morning I'll have one as well wait into please
please deflections are working incredibly well
and we can fish
lettuce fish
it's too late
hello yes I would have we got we have
door up to 125 health
to health and I suspect you will lose more than will gain
stream Raiders
I think would do it anyway
maxed
yes we only need to health
no I don't think we're going to lose as much as We Stand against I think this is a freemax self basically
she was still on 80 or helpful 70 has left
on the boost
navigate
we only need two and we getting 56
and that's kind of a no-brainer really
you going to the shop next week first will you go for stream Raiders
so what have we got we have
7 units on the battlefield
TV 7 units or still do the damage
defensive spell
Wicker Man I strong defensive spell see if I can keep my live as long as possible
John Paul George and Ringo if he's hiding at the top there somewhere
Windows go away but let's rock and roll
has me an extra matrica Against The Beatles
three of them and the Ants
she's going to be a tight one
there is a chance we'll do it there's a chance that we won't
will do it
I know with Rolling Stones
forget it Rock
and we did Rock
we kill the bugs we won the Battle of The Kills
I take other Awards but that's going out of random there's only one person
the land on at random it's extra metrica 15 bonus gold for you buy for me sorry for everybody else
and some more bonus gold from here
yes GG is indeed gold stars for you
and for me
so collect all the things
thank you Daddy
and collecting all the things for the quests
I can't play some other orcs later today but I might be able to get one at the start of the street tomorrow just before that quest expires
got another great now getting towards I get units
20 which is wearing masks
we're going in Seattle this is not going to be so easily if it's gonna be nuisance
that is watching that hasn't base units down this is the battle to place units in
I'm going to need something fairly ft so I think I'm gonna go for centurion here
all the lights you know that Santa has nothing as week to it
notice that one do we have any other healers so that obviously won't have anything weak to it
tanks not necessarily Rogues the hills would be weaker the rogue
not ok so there's nothing with any witness to anything so I'm going to drop the Centurion down
thereby that rock that we need to destroy very quickly
hopefully get something with that
don't you got half an hour fix we will see that
some point soon
Bonobo
we're going shopping
because I think about to come to order boss fight
another burrito we didn't need cos we just got health food at
I'll try and get ourselves
I'm sorry Sharon we just demolished the Aurora
and it would definitely not the Bruno
what do we fancy
I do like having cost as a phone speaker
but hello after you Castle hit with an attack or special fire seeking arrow everytime yes
that is an excellent thing to have
this is not so excellent
he did take it personally unfortunately
is it not too excellent though we're going into a boss fight
support Arrows off fantastic
we like support Arrows they're even better when I've got a ranged weapon
but we're going to see if we can do something with this
get a shield fight where we actually get all the way through here
impressed
got this unlikely but possible
I want to take this serious first
and the reason I take it a serious first it cos I can hit it without him being quite such a problem
where is Lytham Theseus he has to be hit in the face
I just get the dots up
I do want the spell dots up
I was doing alright there I didn't take any damage for ages
that is not backup
£1 in the Wings yes indeed
ok he's down that's good
this guy's a nuisance you have to take him from behind
and he's got a hell of an attack
as I said I've done this with the sword I think when I had health sword
oh great and he calls in Zeus
that is not very fair
he's not supposed to call him the god that's my job
what happens next is I get completely annihilated
I don't try and steal from Sharon he gets very upset about that
come on Theseus
there we go
that is not the first time I've beaten this both boss fight but it is the first time I've been it with the Shield
at level leasing with the shooter chaos and there's my phone
there is my fan my one and only son
thank you don't say thank you very much indeed
110l that's not in the eye
three encounters bonus healthy indeed my legit biggest fan
acvaria School
it's a shame I'm not closer to the boss
is having 15% full
it would be much better
and I of Liar ok that would be useful but again
IKEA 425 gold I masel have that
free encounters I get bonus Halfords time
Will Take That
would definitely take that
no I've been here once or twice before
excellent
burritos in pot money in pots
I've definitely been here before although it doesn't look particularly familiar
yeah I've been here before I definitely remember this b
and unfortunately that's the end of the cherry beer is also going to go back to normal drinks
Adam rather nice cherry beer only go there for a short one
but you know you can't have everything all the time
we have a shop down there
we can't any of the stuff that's in the shop
ideally love to be able to afford this extra blood
we can't though
service is not good let's fast
got to go this way we've got to get the say to sack
got too many bosses
we got healthy got money we got a pom
I think I'm going to go for
money first
because More Money More better
oh yes the poison rats
the poison rats that insist on hurting us
I'm liking these Arrows they're very helpful
ok
we're going through slowly
hello
to deflect that then
Shay
I don't remember seeing much of this
remember it being a nuisance
burrito good
is that a chaos well or is that the X I think that might be the exit
mastiff fight
I should have been dead there
are good rats as well
because what I really need right now a rats and more exploding things
I'm good
money
I don't want that
did I see a shop as well my soul some more money
that is the exit
so we got the money but we wasted it all used to justify in the process
that was unhelpful what is this Anvil
I swapped 142 hello
swap 142 sounds very good indeed
but I guess we lose one that we like in favour of two that might not be so useful
the max health is always about about available shack
do you want to Max health do I want a boon
I definitely want the max life at hi there Paul definitely want the moon as well
hello
take another fated one
the Divine florist there that would have been lovely but at taking a feted one it's always wise
I'll take the Palm next
upgrade something
we basically have to do all these anyway
it doesn't matter which order we do them in really
what have you got in this shop restore life
could be useful
yeah definitely
random item
battle definitely be useful
Leicester bonus damage
the things with armour which one of these rats have
that's ok
burrito that's definitely good
ok
anymore for anymore no
navigate Street Motors up folks let's see some more hello
ok I can upgrade divine strike
or expose backstab damage
let's take the bonus attack damage
that was
hello
health yes please
that's that surprising I don't actually need to do the other rooms
when I feel like doing the other room is probably a good idea but I don't actually need to do them
this is the furthest we got here I think
I think this is now personal best
I think we got this far before
I can't afford anything else here
why is this got fancy lines coming of it
escape Sharon's ambrosia
excellent
is a good start
ok now I can't do any of the rooms because I've done the servicing
is this the point where we actually fight 80 so wonder
have we just got the furthest we've ever got in this game before
definitely got before
ok yes
this is officially the furthest we've got
oh dear
is not an apple traffic
he's not happy at all
oh dear yeah not so dear I don't think I think they go he'll be badly
excuse me that was a bit unfair
turn it off and clobbering me that hard
where's he going to come from
I will keep hitting him I think this is a valid approach
ok I need to hide here at this point I think
or is it no it's not there
welcome back KSP
you come back at the furthest point we've ever got 2 in this game so far
we've never yet had to fight Hades with all
that has just changed we are now fighting Hades
the boss
that was a waste of a god shot
excuse me
endgame no I think this is just a start
I think this is just the start of the
this is not going well though
it's not going at all well
yep
did not go well as expected
understanding is that wants you if you manage to kill him
you then go back around again and again and again and get more of the story each time
redacted
oh dear
thank you Daddy
Achilles a smart
is a lot taller
when we got over here
office is going to be happy
just a good year
something like that something like that
now we will try and achieve it
navigate Street Motors still going folks make sure you get some of these units down on the battlefield
Darkness Anarchy for doing some fishing
always worthwhile things to do
have a good enough Darkness quite for an extra testify
and another 45 Darkness
come and I haven't got no keys yet for this I've got 2630 hey Jimmy how you doing
good to see you buddy go to see
what round are we going to do this time ok we're going to do the gun run

in a minute is gonna grumpy I'm talking about it I'm sure
I'm sure ksb can teach it about cookies later
yeah I mean to be honest and say we've done precise easy training with it so far
so this is just it's best attempt based on
whether the existing code is to try and understand DJ

it's not this one
I know so it's intentional that it cause night but
because I want nightball to still do things
so is intentional that it's called in commands from other bot
that is the way we wanted to be
there's a couple of reasons for that
theoretically yes it could do things itself
this is an intentional design decision
Daedalus hammer
ricochet fire
attack deals to okay well we need to fight it 1
what are the fated one
hello hello that's actually a pretty decent fated one
like that
money
yes exactly what I S pizza
keeping one but updated is a lot easier than updating to
plus there's already plenty of general chapels out there
and I don't want to say night but might get lonely if we decommissioned it
sober
but there's some other special things that also DJ will be able to do
we have cunning and evil plans
occasionally some people coming plans as well
we do have an AI expert involved in the project
but yes there is a i coded up
which one do we go for we haven't seen Zeus for a while
say hi to Zeus
we haven't seen from him in ages
don't give access to nukes
Skynet is coming
ok that's nice
yep once had some extensive testing
used to what's going on
we can make it available to a few more people
now what do you want
special causes lightning box
Lightning Bolts
dash causes Lightning Bolts I think definitely
America's history murders
that's just check there's no health left here that
yeah lightning Dash
ok let's just remembered before we go to this minibus
what have I got we have
we have 10 hours on the field
we have a whole bunch of anime this is probably not going to go to well
but where can I go for it anyway
go for defences because I think we're going to need it
was 10 allies on the field and far too many oz Beatles and heels and everything else
let's rock and roll
that's the Rock time
and some of the ants no we just got hope we can get the roll down as well
if we stay in this area
we have got that defensive spell which will help a little bit
getting swarmed with a lot of enemies so I don't think they're going to go to well
swarm is just going to be too much especially when there's Beatles turn up
but so far so good
we haven't completely snuffed it yet
there is a chance it's not a high chance but there is a chance
little paladin at the top doing it's thing
this is not going well
can we take the beetle down can we get to the vehicle
we took the vehicle down can we take the rest of his hands down this is going better than I expected it there still a rock to take out the top there
I got the Ants Dan
warn epic unit each going for this rock
latest unit is almost dead
magic is monkeys doing the best dollhouse
my centurion doing a thing
we got there
we got there
that was a nice effort
everyone let's get the most kills and 36 me getting the most
extra metrical getting an honorable mention for being up there with 30 kills
and absolutely storm it all
me on the top sports Awards at random
extra match picking up the Centurion Les picking up the Barbarian everybody else getting 6 gold
15
on my machine it does a freedom
and yeah
homegrown
oh come on KSP
go on
that's a big plus so is the Swedish flag
well if you're going to do that
you can have all of them
you want a quicker if I have the right side up
it was indeed an easy one
anyway let's get it on the toads now
more units based on
what have you got what quests have we got win battles win battles get units to level 20
so we can't do that cuz they're on cooldown
I get you to level 20 what I think what I can go into London
the fight is turned and I didn't think I'd need those noises tonight
so you know
later when you got half an hour
silver no
the 80s
the Script that's fine enables alright channels but if I got the faders down that doesn't actually help all that much
the fader needs to be up
it was intentionally babe
does need to be up though
I have indeed got two separate channels on the side effects
and Wickerman bringing in that rate
rocket are you doing good to see you buddy
do indeed have righteous
we have Hades we have Raiders
assuming this works which if it does
much thank you so much for that follow
if this works

how we doing where it reaches it's good to see you
supposed to have a voice activated shout out
I will get that sorted later
but welcome to each and everyone of you who's coming for the raid
it's great to see you all
play some of you know me already somewhere you don't
mpj I'm a Rider stringer from the UK and right now I'm causing plenty of trouble and we testing a new bottle that is basically to take over the world very soon
but it's good to have all of you here so hoping you don't you guys are doing great
female personal best on his
because I know that's what I was going forward personal best tonight
what do we get
every time you test it must be the accent
maybe the problem is you coded if your accent not quite
it is possible
here we got deadly flourish
we got true shot
hopefully got after Mrs able have annoyed
faults on a man for false
false
I can only I should go for gold here but all the Champs but actually I want the darkness
otherwise loads of new track runs nice
the reason I want the darkness because I'm so close to unlocking another testify
that's not so I know my limits including include not being able to
who owns what
how is the time for 10K
I hadn't realised this as a Titan one
America
JP my opinion on this game is that is absolutely fantastic incredibly playable
there is a lot of replayability in it as well
it's a lot more complex than it looks it's not just running around smashing everything
although there's an element of Smashing everything involved
but my opinion is if you get the option absolutely grab it
and if you ask Wix opinion he's very fond of the first boss
right now I'm running around with the machine gun that also has a grenade launcher built into it
it is very much a repetitive roguelite
icy Road light rather than Road like
there is an element of progression for you do upgrades each time
are ucl upgrade some of the time
it's not guaranteed you getting upgrade every time but most of the time
we've got
basically a very ridiculously overpowered machine-gun
and occasional burrito is now do it chaos chaos is a good shout
and Chaos music another avoiding mini-boss or
but it's 22 health
is the property of Chaos gives you interesting Boons
text me away you're ready to give you something
but they take health that we can get to
I'm going to do it even though it's going to hit me for 22 health
now normally
does fishing spot live
what is a burrito that gives me some of the health back
we're going to take this June
there's a lot of cheese you're boon type stuff coming on as well
so
oh wow
58% more foes but the 94% bonus backstab
reduce life better booms after
or we can have
the money would normally be good but we're good on money at the moment although I say that
they're all pretty good yes
this is fantastic that is a game that I'm thinking of picking up at some point
yeah Neil this is great
these are all pretty good choices
to go for the moons
well that's 37 health
reduction
that's
more than half of my current health
it's not half my total health but is more than half the hell they have left
the top Choice
I think the 30% bonus money is the one we're going to have to go for
let's do the fishing
you get fishing in this game as well because fishing
obviously you got to wait until it flashes like that
phantom Iris I haven't played
this haven't played that one
was that the one that
play the other day where you run through a tomb
or am I comparing that was something else or confusing with something else
yes it was ok that look cool
my kind of game
very much going the
40 less rapid destruction route here
trying to stay alive
burrito burrito the health
and bonus Max health
ok we got some coin there
what we doing the Smashing all these parts because we have
an item in our hands that potentially drops
Doritos from these parts
which is why we smashing with the pots
shaky from me boss
Bowmore darkest dark this is health
Darkness is where we go
especially when everything we kill is throwing more stuff Atlas
cancel the unreasonable amounts of acid grenades being thrown ASUS
ok does a burrito we need that
throw some grenades over
use the grenades get rid of the enemies
and we have a shop and we have plenty of money
it heard shadow please right
that is not what I said
that is definitely not what I said
something
would definitely have four words with it later and teach it how I speak
Sharon helpful as always
we can afford all of these
I'll take all of them

there we go that's what we wanted from earlier
that's what we wanted
having how cold is that
if I need work first time
oh that doesn't sound healthy Seamus that sounds very unhealthy in fact
selling loud pop
extra magic at altar DJ will not shout itself out it's been very confused as I mentioned it's name as well
will not shout itself out
smarter than that
special deals more damage in oxo's Airways cost deal damage and Wroxham away getting a random assortment of Treasure
that's ok smile you can add to a proper job
he's hoping
I want treasure
that is quite a lot of Treasure
ok it wasn't as much as it could have been
but there was some money
money is good
I guess it depends what went pop
if it was a capacitor on GPU or something
the temperature will work fine if it
until such time as stuff the power get a very dirty or maybe on the load so it could be something where
see some damage on the load or something
yes 30 is handy
special speed
which is the grenade gun
useful
bonus Dash
bonus dash is always
a good shout
it's always a good especially going into a boss fight where dashing is kind of a requirement
yeah don't keep it on things if it starts doing funky stuff under load
it might be worth having a quick look at it
might also be worth if you want take some things apart of some points if you work out where the
and see if there's anything obviously damaged and if so take some photos and send them to me because it might be something is easily fixable
I get the case off of the side of it and have a quick sniff inside in case there's something that I didn't get out
because it's a possibility there's some inside
a sniff test was ok ok that's good
I mean a positive sniff that is always a good thing to have
ok she's in vulnerable that's bad
this is also bad
this is definitely not going as well as it could
Donna let's go get away from me
ok just before used
where's reasons I don't use this gun very often by choice
is pop with the Seals went yeah could do
sjp so you choose one weapon per run
of the 60 from Western Auctions so there's a sword is a shield there's a gun as a bow is a spear and there's the fists which are like oversized knuckle dusters
so you get one weapon per run
I'm specifically taking the gun Mr because each rung you get one weapon give you bonus Darkness and for me Darkness is also converted into health
so by running the option that gives me darkness into health
I get
regenerate on a pickup Darkness essentially
you choose one weapon you take that through its run
and then you changed on the next one if you want to
ok so
I think slinfold dropping on health is always useful
I'm not cheap let's have that because it is cheap
you don't have to buy anything from the shop but you do have to use the Health Act in progress past
so this room because it's the first one
will not have any enemies it because the first one after the boss fight
it will have pots and things is just to show you what the area looks like in things
and pots sometimes contain health for me
no video on Facebook yes
that's why I'm wondering if it's 14 smoothing caps on your graphics card that went pop
I've seen that happen before
I would say definitely something take a photo of it and send it over to me see it see any busted caps on there
if a big pasties I'll be easy to spot
who can get the cold in stop them
how do you say all the big cats
literally just sold Henry saw them very easily
I could do without thinking twice
so yeah if that's what it was they'll be fairly easy to replace
and capital the most likely think I should go pop
sound like that
other things can do
weird Suffolk fastest editor
penguin pop
he's anything like that
we can get you sorted out
oakley.com I need that
ok upgrade the Artemis age deadline
should be what woodwork after if a cabbage on
it depends
after that goes won't work
Sony there two twin fire-breathing that raid how you doing buddy
welcome welcome twin fire and Raiders great to see you

there we go
a couple of attempts sometimes
gets there
but yes welcome radar great see you all hope you're doing ok
but yeah speak is a smoothing capacitor
stop it working it will just some potentially mean that interference might get into the system later which is why so keep an eye on it and if it starts misbehaviour full load and stuff that's when
biggest chance of it
needing smoothing because that's when you likely to get ripple in the power
and smoothing caps only exist source
make it less roughly
so if it is that then it should work fine until such time as something starts misbehaving
by misbehaving dodgy graphics is definitely symptom which is why I'm still wondering if it's not based on what you said earlier
you know it could be anything from artefacts on the screen to suddenly everything goes black and stops working or
there's many options for what it could do
it's worth keeping an eye and seeing what happens
will take that health
and darkness
have you got a key on the next song
yeah there's some a few things it might happen
he's a big smoothing capacitor you'll be able to see because the little bustard open on it
leather little cylinders that use it vertically on the board and they're very obviously they've gone
is the top of the pops open and guts of spill out of it basically
you're no
these witches are annoying
they could just die that would be appreciated
this is the weapon the speedrun is use for the fastest finishes
I don't know how because he doesn't feel like I'm particularly fast weapon to me
apparently it is the one that speedrun is favour
it's about to get me very dead very quickly madgin
I sent you trying to get me that
ABBA yes dodgy graphics is certainly
have we got any fishing spots
that is not a fishing spot
that's the entrance
have an exit with
I think exit via the gift shop is the
choice in the situation
I love a little shop me
Woodside health
so we've got 162 ok
let's buy the 50 house
unless by the poem
let's upgrade
attack damage because base attack damage is always worthwhile
let's give him another
they've had a couple more those now
one more and we unlock a thing
I'm not sure what's thing we unlock but this is a minibus now this is potentially very very bad
or is this
yes this is a mini boss
I'll come on
now look
this is not going well
I keep getting turned to stone
Turn to Stone is a bad thing to have
this is why I dislike this gun
it's not a very effective weapon
oh good I died
ok well we killed her
there we go
alright the movement which doesn't have with the gun yes
pretty much
ok true shot is handy
critical damage marking
encrypt vs aqua Oak 145 percent damage vs armour definitely
anything fun around here
I have a feeling this runs not going to a very far because we got no testifies left
and we can't get any back necessarily well we might get one back in a little shop
if we get as far as the Little Shop
what is it cricket
I didn't realise we gone to the Oval
Sally Scholes are annoying
McConnell words with butter

Mr rapid fire

shop is always a wise choice
shopping is excellent
even if he's not very happy with I just shot him in the face
what do I want out of this shop
haven't got the max health up
and that was stupid
off I go to amiibos
Argos
the one weapon that can I see
very short work of this lot
I just stand here in Spanish avoid myself being hit repeatedly
I'm sure they would didn't designers for this but
it works
I'd really appreciate if they could going to stop with the lava
Malaga is the only problem here
the rest of this

there we go
you know what makes the code is terrible jokes
how are you said yes please

shut up Siri does not require certain commands
I feel like that's a solid one
revenger damages also good
I'm special damage

of the three options that is the one worthwhile
omis weather
if we had boner special damage last time
I got a son like that minibus a lot quicker

and I just started the boss fight
and we'll leave the boss fight until after we done stream Raiders
just keep everything running
history m and get straight into that bossfight
what have we got we got a small clump of units appear which look like they're going to do some serious damage
I got a big clump of units down here which looks like they're going to need some health this quite will take 10 seconds or less give these guys some paste
is it lots of them there
rock and roll we have 40 alloys
we have 17 enemies it will hopefully be over very quickly
I didn't even take 10 seconds
that was 5 maybe 6
KSP jnsq hu5 extra metrical getting the most assists with 4 and extra magic are also going out tops what with a combined total of 8

and yeah it's great having here
Wigan have a centurion right about here
and hopefully we're going to see plenty of units down on the field we're gonna Crush this battle
see that in half an hour or so carry the street go buddy
I wasn't
are you alright did indeed work
that is why you got a shout out
you were late here that's fine
that is fine buddy
it's good to have you here whenever you get here
ok the heads are coming out
if a dog is a bands of dying yeah understandable
there's no fun when you got nobody to talk to
makes a bit hard to make Radio contact if there's no we have to
I love this photo
the multi shot on is insane
toccata kill his
ok he's gone impervious again
please heads are a nuisance I need to die
oh that's a testify
I'll come along learning
I know you grumpy but
there's no need for that behaviour
we are just going to burn it Down
understanding So Close To Bone Hydra head is not good idea
electrical store saying talk to someone in the past
that's pretty handy
yeah so we lost a testify there we have a third on to use these days
but you will go with it
it's good to see you here
that was useful as well
what have you got on here replenisher testify yeah we haven't got a 200 Gold
always a technicality I frog always a technical
ok
I got full health now
so let's take chaos
let's see what case is going off for a system
no berita
ok
dinosaur tag damage
bonus gems
an extra spell
Ernest Jones cos that's also burn herself
pretty certainly do by the game
would not disagree with that
it is an excellent game and Incredibly playable
and if you're not me
you'll be rather well at it
new things Diane they going to little blue all the things you have to kill the Alby thing
otherwise they respawn as well
and then respawning is bad
oh good butterflies
and traps lots of traps
yeah we'll see
I don't understand that actually know how to get started with that
if anybody has any hints
if anybody is done it knows how you can get some affiliation links
Amal is shoot me a DM let me know
what does bonus gems
that is a very good question I am assuming you mean things like combo
Amazon possible as well
ok these are nuisance because I got Shields
yeah he's a definitely nuisance with their Shields
yes I'm not overly keen on Jambox it feels like a lot of people have done it the death already
Latin as with everything I kind of don't like having to be relying on other people to get content
it's nice to have people involved
but I don't want any situation where
stream requires
me to have other people around and people aren't around
that's certainly not something I would do on like I want to week basis for anything
yeah maybe
alright that did a lot of damage to us
PowerShot is easier to execute that would be useful
special piercing photos more useful
ok so we got a shop
and we don't want to buy anything from the shop we also have the reactivation which will give us money
and we do want the money
worry about losing I wouldn't be playing any games on stream
you can't tell me that
I'm playing games and I'm worried about losing
are they would of course
let's take some of the backstabbers here
this is not gonna be worth the money anymore
yeah that is not worth a 13 gold
that was totally not worth 13 gold
especially with the minibus coming up next
hopefully the streams come back
are we back
again OBS is saying it's not lost any friends
sounds come back in no picture ok interesting
Tobias Tobias is who is responding perfectly
not lost any frames it did go red room
lose any friends in process
so it's not an abs fault
had a couple of times it seems to beat which being on the blink again
yeah it seems like they're on the drink or something
live diving and have a look at this one
oh good gigantic butterfly boss
oh good and a desk if I wasted
yeah this is not gonna go well at all
I'm hoping we get the Encounter at the moment gives us or testify back
cos right now I could really use a test if I recharge
I don't think I'm going to get one
I think there's minibuses going to do me in
yep demian
did me in
damn minibuses
always a nuisance
and yeah dirty looks like he's touching this multiple people having a sis
Iveco from office
he would say that we just two path which it's a possibility KSP it's a possibility
ok he's singing he's singing nicely
I do like the singing The Singing is good
I want my god to say to us now
it's quite nice yeah it's which goes horribly wrong we can do something else somewhere else
juicer
I mean that is a reasonable suggestion as well KSP
that is a reasonable suggestion
rocket league on discord
it's possible
the rocket League command does indeed work
India shopping
what's twitch doing now
hello
that sounds like a hint
that sounds absolutely like a hint
3-second pause
a 3-second pause

before you know
yes also DJ is new and shiny croc Quest
new shiny in front of flavours
you had to ask didn't you
I won't answer you lot
money
you may not have evidence of it
I read out appropriate things
and I don't believe that something that it's been programmed to understand anyway
you remember it's very much a work in progress
it's for science
it's for something
the Sciences how much do you pay to use KSP decided to go dim
the answer is not quite that much
let's have the darkness
I'm pretty sure you haven't coded that one it was not on the original spec list
where are you now
you want to believe
believe
there's believing and there's insanity
I'm not come across this boss before
this is new to me
that's probably actually a KSP
it's not a science
yes definitely
what is the dash we want that deflect
and that is 3 m
what have you got this one we have
43 alloys on the field
I can't really fast
talking really fast they can get a taste
LEGO be really fast
and with the rock and roll
is a rock there
there's no one there
have you got the zoomies in
that road running after that Rock
yeah he wasn't started staying slow
this battle is normally pretty disco on with all the Ants
I think we got it this time though
yes indeed Alexa is capable of that
I believe Google is also capable of that
to be careful saying that
don't want to trigger my home assistant
that is pretty much certain KSP
congratulation getting the most kills of 20 twin fire most assists with 7
the Agra overall top spot with that 24
what's the weather going out of random 200 Gold landing on blissbox
circling on a frog every as getting a gold and 75 for me $75 and I've got a lot of gold now I need to spend some of this
I might go to the shop later in Spencer
I might go to the shop now and spend some
you can always go to the shop
and you can throw some gold
shop and upgrade your rogue
opera is upgrade my rogue
that's upgrade my rogue
I'm still have 1700 gold
are schools still nice Scrolls are always nice
so
in the cat boss I've not seen the cat box before
we want to see it tonight
we will see the cat bus tomorrow night
for now though
the fight to do and I think I'm going to round off with a warrior the last time tonight
let's have warrior up here where we can take out beetle first
coming on the toilet afterwards
so we'll see that in half an hour
Ronaldo
you got a choice to make do we go for a key or do we have some daughters
I think we go for the darkness
hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk to you again
this is a survive 45 seconds
tiny spook wear
adaptaflex and Dash strike is excellent with his shield
I tried to survive another 10 seconds
that was excellent
I will take that healing
any success introducing mega that was a big job at the back of a going out of hell is not going well lucky
where to get as far as having a fight with Hades
never got
partially luck is not a judgement
we did get there though

no we don't need to buy more health because when maxed
70 burrito
I can't afford both the moon and the max health though
no maxhealth is usually pretty good

KSP is created something
is definitely created something
ok what have we got here then
fishing spots ok fine
Poseidon
RC toasty that's controversial
and I might call into question night but sanity
yeah don't step In The Fire stepping in the fire is bad
yes it's worse than a monster
special deals more damage and not supposed away
I'll take that I'll take a call
some weights
everything you are surfing
ok we've got a character counter
nails too long I hope you got 10 squishy mechanical keyboard on your laptop
I hope You're Rocking the cherry keyboard
if you want we can have words with your manager
I hope you're rocking one of those cherry MX keyboard key
play this promote which no
I was given this by skill a friend
last Christmas
I was talking about buying it but I didn't actually then play it
until I started streaming
in fact I was streaming before receiving it
no cherry on the G Series
very sad
you need to have words
of course is your gaming laptop
what do we want
2 Boons upgraded
the westering before
before of Austrian before in general
I hate you I played it about 6
months ago for
67
Christmas I played this of it
and I stream it
so I did know was after we done Valhalla Valhalla was
first games on Street
since we finished mph
very definitely since we finished 1-hour
no I think I think having a 2-day respond immediately is good
purely because otherwise I get concerned that he's ignoring me
so I think an instant response is fine
what have we got
upgraded rarity
newborns get upgrade rarity
I mean to be honest you guys or figure out of the box answering me because that's all whatever does
where is delay in it's going to make me wonder if it's working or not
I rather know it was working and
arrived just before I arrive
plus nomad of the delay that you put in
there's a very big gonna be somebody with motorline and others
3 seconds there
I seen people have up to 30 seconds delay so you know you can put in 3 seconds and it would still turn up before a lot of people see in chat or before a lot of people see me asking
so is so variable that I think it's worth just running it's instant
that's my fault on it
stupid
are you can try to have it respond to key cut
how many course I can break things very effectively that point
I think we're going to the shop though
oh yes fishing Mr
did I miss an actual fishing spot
little ones
are we just saying fishing in general
Alice sham00k
they already have enough I don't know other people causing problems
Max health
and a minibus I don't worry geeky there's plenty of other things that we're going to happen
yeah I really dislike these witches they are a nuisance
especially when they insist on standing in the lava
are we not had that yet it's on the fight it less let's have it
there are other options that are possibly better but fated list is
something was trying to complete
the fated list is basically a sort of checked
collected every boon or something like that
detect points rewards very nice
very nice indeed
all the DJ get the drinks in
alto DJ get the drinks in
my order doesn't want to get the drinks in
I'm not mumbling
it was so mumbling going on there
I forgetting around in there
never understood me fine
he getting the whining
I did not say also
so we need to teach it to recognise its own name better
ok
it doesn't know who it is let alone anything else
I think it needs some voice training to be fair
and as I said earlier that we haven't done any voice chat
so
to be honest I'm impressed it's doing anything at all with no training
I think is doing you than find job
I'm talking to do it and find job we're off to the shops
I'm pronouncing his name just find Kiki
I think the body just has a bad attitude I think that's what it is
it's got an attitude and it's showing off
at showing off in front of all of you lot
that's what's happening here the boxer show off
oh good the version of him to spitzfire everywhere
does what I need when I'm dashing around the whole time is something that spits fire
that's really what I need isn't
I'll come on you
ok we want to be out of the way here
it's a very dashie weapon combo so we need to keep moving
through the fire
even if we are taking lot of damage out of it
no that was a nice meal got ability
there we go

likes testing
it doesn't Sunnymead testing bit like stick
I'm not singing
you do not want me to sing
I think we just need to
heaven forbid a bit of a drinking string
if that happens it can get very very confused
I want to say very very confused
I mean that point
the Somerset twang will come out the back of my accent
completely confused all at the bottom
that boy is not gonna understand a word I say
you play bits for what me drinking
haven't had some beer before I started to stream today
I was on those cherry beers again giki
baritone DJs currently on the air
the thing is a drunk stream is gonna be like a SodaStream only with less good gaming
he's given me a thing
a thing that does a thing
what is the sindhu
it's not going to tell me
and inhibitions football
well you know
if a Jobs worth doing it's worth doing well
ok Siri this is annoying I need to take the one I haven't taken yet
I can't want to take the rapid fire cast
a sex with flashing lights on the Codex
oh nice
and I've got a hammer
I do like a good hammer
Megan are very kind of you to say so
the date of the summer
just right deals 50% damage
Terraria
oh yes definitely dash strike
what can we get here up to 100 Darkness
I can neither confirm nor deny the answer to that question
when you collect relation ask what you weren't necessarily get the correct answer either
ancient dragon in human form
I mean the samba say that
what is a shop got
we don't need
random item we don't need
Andy shop
I can't remember
I can't remember if I told you
what currency is Kiki
call grumpiness
it's under the hour amateur
I don't know
is it ok right yeah one or two to definitely two
always two if there's an option for 2
Aries first
what are we going to have
that seems reasonable
battles is reasonable and that seems very reasonable for a boss fight where I'm likely to need it
and he's not happy as he he's not happy at all
I won't be angry for long
having a disorder in for quite a while
well one of them regenerated
but I wanted the house
navigate
oh hello even better we got another one
ask what a cool one
who has wine
what is there one in where is the wine
and do so is like at home
home
she does a lot of good cleaning does juicer
an expert in the old tidying up as well
the Rams always gone
about Isis is grumpy because
I preferred his brother Ares
why was grumpy had wine so he was happy again
that's why he was gonna be there
can you filter provided Brother game
so
we got now
we have poseidon's aid upgrade
a pressure upgrade
overwatch the kill upgrade
search to kill
yeah I think the air is being first so don't like Scott grumpy
10% health but chamber 3 Chambers
where are we going to now
digger for hammer
yeah let's take the
extra house
as possibly the difference between us getting something next time and not getting something next time but
send a text to c
excellent
happy days
I got some house back there as well
I'll come on sanitiser B much done 1000 damage for his
when I don't get to do 1000 damage your hit
take that window
Daedalus hammer
attack it's twice but does not back yes
and burn herself and Maddie Street Motors
let's take care of three Motors
it will be the last three modes battle of the night thank you wick we got we got as far as haiti's earlier for the first time we can beat him we got as far as him
ok this lot can have a big defensive spell right about here
let's rock and roll 43 hours on the field for the last time tonight
let's see what happens here
I tried taking the most kill to begin with Willy Holdem and seems likely
assists for taking the overall top spot
is Rose going out of random
getting a bonus grow yet again flight Paris Evans getting some gold and me
gold is good wheel
so we can do another fight or two we've got about another 10 minutes or so so we're going to see how far we get the darkness all the gems and the darkness is what we need cos it gives us health
we did indeed find my Julia
she's definitely asking about something
clingy
are you would say that wouldn't you work
I quite like I quite like this double damage actually or double hit no doubt back
I quite like that is an ability
that's some serious stuff
that's a burrito
let's have gold
I need the gold
and they're not right handy but
the extra hits just been everything dies faster
besides which I have a deflect on
anyway
that'll do nicely for that
making sure it wasn't stalking now now there's another that
let's not be in the farriers now
Adidas I'd follow my radar Christmas
you follow my ride
that is the way we do this
and we go to the shop
the correct answer is always follow my rate
if you follow the road you get Channel points and you get a support the next room that we pick
what do we want
yes we definitely want
our heroic buna hello
attacking flex Doom
doom is good
I've not had
I've not had heroic boon before
but it will take away my epic
that is a lot of Doom
is it better than an epic drunken strike
special summon Flix to mobile don't use special that much
actually cost sending a blade Rift would be a decent
using caster the boss fight
but attack inflicting doom I don't know
I don't think I can find out my oh yeah I can
ok so drunken strike
6 damage every half a second
vs125 damage one shot I think 125 damage one shot is actually going to be better
I think that's going to be better each time
yeah I will take that
I will take the pump as well
oh and we can upgrade the Doom
or we can trade the dash deflect
upgrade the Doom
the Doom
and then for the last run of the night
maybe or maybe not depending on how this goes
he says that
I mean he might be right sorry might be wrong
and deliberately not using the ability yet
I want to charge it up to full
how is using Artemis is he
I think it may be not use Artemis that would be useful
that's the ball down
and now the bulldozer
that's the easiest I've done that fight so far
shiki knows what she's at
doomies indeed immense
and doing with the Shield that does double hits
because yes I took the knock back off but I put double hits on instead
so that she got
where is it
that one Paul Rose in blue
it's twice so double do me
that was bonkers good
Lee Sin combo
I feel like that was the correct way to do that
what have you got in the shop
nothing particularly useful
let's wander up here
delete all the oldest roller pots and done I've not yet beaten Hades
got to him for the first time
navigate Beckenham
never
and as always we got a shop
the big shop
and love Darkness yeah
come soon if it doesn't I'll be very very disappointed
the talking coming soon
it would indeed come soon
but it won't be tonight
because I'm going to do with a bit of ringing the music
it is that time that time we go for a raid
let's see who's on
you know I've got to get you guys come out tomorrow somehow haven't I
that's right we will be back tomorrow we will be continuing this tomorrow from that point
right now cause we are going to go and do a raid
as we always do
it is going to be one of our own
if we one of our own who we haven't seen for
a short while
it is a course gonna be
Chris x Chad
I do stick around for that
we'll see him at the moment I'll see you guys tomorrow night
until then as always stay safe
see you on the discord
very good evening how are we doing
happy Wednesday good to see you Turkey
go to c
I got to be honest that joke is pretty decent
is it what do you call a ladybug with a tartan pattern
hey ksb how we doing
yes the side effects of kicking off early tonight
it's happening
we're back
we have the bop
I will do it hopefully
about it thing hopefully what I mean is it left your base tonight
misbehaving a bit last night and getting jitters a bit
anyway got 3 minutes up
get yourself a unit down on the battlefield
Yogi I think the command you want use exclamation hello
it doesn't necessarily recognise you he speak directly at it
there was no mumbling going on ksb no mumbling at all
and actually you could coding compensation for that if you wanted to
we have faith in your abilities to code

this is concerning I've got to be honest

well I think we've had enough on with that we can get kicking off with the Strain
so let's do some Hades and let's see how far we get with it tonight
hopefully we can continue where we left off
and make some progress because we got here last time
lots of shop stuff
mcgrumpy Carol
ok so we're doing shield on and we've got the dash t-flight
no we definitely want the money money is always a good shout
take money to start with
no no
that's enough of that
that is more than enough of that
Explosions going on
oh good
lots of strange Gorgon likes things
which organs are crystals
excellent

navigate it knows who it is
this is taking the mickey of it
excuse me no
ok we didn't quite get enough to
that is incredibly bad for health
none
this is not a good health to have
I think wheeze
340 we should probably take
when I get to Burns here
always have a pump to Boons is probably better
I think that's going to be useful
having bonus backstab damage on anything can deflect
let's take this one as well
Soccerway fixed bonus damage to bosses
that would be useful I think again Mercedes because that's who we're going to go up against in a minute
but then actually no because it will give us
random assortment of stuff including health and dark little G's also bonus health
right ok let's give us some health
not as much as out of likes but some
some is better than none this is the policy here
what do we want do you want a bhuna don't upgrade I want another
yeah I go for another woman
ok the Little Shop here
we won't have enough money for that
check the shop
actually we have got enough money for
that
we've actually got enough money for that one as well because we haven't got money for any of the things of the big shops left
what time close 2
oh good a burrito
I like a good burrito
that went surprisingly well
Wellow
what's this
I'll come along
he could not I'd appreciate it
and a burrito that was useful
the poison rats just what I don't need
is the poison rats I got poison all around the Year poison fountain
that was not healthy at all
ok no probs there
looking good on the hotel front
is it absolutely
looking good
I want to help counting
things was not aware in fact also rupture
no more sunken treasure
muscle contracture because more sunken treasure is
because I didn't take me to the health but it did take me to further up
and I the Little House there
I know a whole lot more confident because we haven't got like said health and we've done all bits we technically have to do here
you don't technically have to do these encounters
we could just go straight in at this point
and since going to die at the end of eternal atake upon
let's take a Boost
have a double boost undefined Dash
I could be handy
we can have a boost on the bonus damage
I think an instant or extra 3% damage boost is going to be the one to go for
a sack of fitted rotting meat
and separate from the way
and of course we get to fight with a again
it's a little bit bright
if that's a lot bright
author DJ get the drinks in
not feeling like it
he's going to burn a lot of these capes I feel
OK he's going to come back
this do my thing we've got
is going to do some serious damage
is it stop me hitting he's also take 120 doom damage
if you could maybe behave yourself a bit that would be appreciated
I'm trying to get that God Gave to full down the bottom left there
is a full god gave gives me in significant boost
ok this is not going to badly
I mean this can't be the end of it but I got a good feeling about this run
ok we've had office testify
did we just win
Anna stubbings liquid difficult with a shield librarian
little bit better with a shield
I'll come along
I sent you because I get a test if I so does he that is not nice
I got high DPS wrong this time though
oh that's no fun
it's not fun at all
that was not fun
OK I got one more zestify
one more chance roller
I just got a burning down
did I just do that a Siberian how you doing
did we just get off first win
think when they've just got the first time that we completed run
yeah cos she could be interested in is the state of the dog
ok
it's not very easy
it took a while getting on with that
the first of many apparently
record 32 minutes 43 seconds ok
1 run with the Shield
and you get to see all the bones that you used
I'm not sure what this is doing
you know
don't have things on them
alright so the pins show them on the screen right
that makes sense so you can see which things you had
right
oh good when we get another blood this Lexus unlock weapon updates
I've watched plenty of strings of this
I just haven't necessarily pay much attention to people completing it
is Germany what is a complete and do something else
Galaxy the story behind it
we made a Chimneys land
where is Jimmy

oh she's not very happy
she doesn't seem very happy
oh dear
she suddenly became very happy
Normans have been writing the missing it's getting but we appear to be doing the whole cutscene thing yeah no worries you come back when you can
yeah no worries Taka enjoy the painting and plastering
yeah no worries thanks for hanging out
do you stop back anytime you like
not accustomed to the weather that's a very British thing
hello there
GTA Sadler
I'm likely
no
we're going back in
hopefully not salon hopefully we'll get through again
I feel like with no open the door
and that was a decent been run
it was a decent run indeed
yes we did

oh yeah maybe
and have a look in the administrative chamber
alchemy attempt 45 escape
is 45 attempts to get out
ok yeah that's fine
let's leave that to itself rivet
a favourite character that is a difficult question to answer is a very difficult question to answer
I'm not sure I can also that
there are too many good characters with cerberus come
having service is always the best character
he's not very happy
Nichols that is 3 m we will take care of that
a moment
we need some more gems really got 358 2500
all that was nice
somebody's upgrade upgrades will get later I'm going to be awesome
heinous
oh dear
she claims she didn't know but that sounds like rubbish to me
yep
Ibiza
autism
egg liver spots Aiden
make it not very happy
flat Eric
fishing I don't think we did that time
we ought to do that is good to take care of that streamers battle
is that time
what time will be the first battle of the night
and we have 11 alloys on the field
I think we definitely want a defensive
let's get it then let's get it on let's rock and roll
18 and a 11 alloys
I think we can do this
I think we should have this in the bag
so far is looking good
looking excellently fact
we're getting killed in Clans cause killing some things or assisting with some things
there are debts there are assist
Motorsports taken the most kills I would 9 clients call taking the most assists with two and Lewis partaking the overall top spot with that night
Miranda everything takes all 3 top spots the number one the most Kills on the most assists the guaranteed reward
this good spots get a couple of Busters in KSP getting a bomber
getting 6 gold of course and I get a barbarian for me troubles
and we're one fight away from the giant cat
never thought giant cat before we don't know what do you like cat will be like
but we are going in that direction
first we got to be the Ants though and these ants are looking decidedly unhealthy
have I got a quest place any units I haven't either
level 20 and there's nothing that week's my centurion is anything that's weeks on my warrior and yes excellent The Beatles a week to the warrior
the stick the wire up there
we'll see this in half an hour's time
does units in it yourself on the battlefield and
what's going on here
I can claim some rewards
I can claim this reward now I can't
I've still got some bones I need to accept first
including that one which I haven't got
I must have something else though cos I was sure that I saw
ok that's new
Orpington ransacking
Dr flexions ok
there was definitely something else that we completed
is we had a pop-up saying that we picked up
full prophecy
that we only need one more Aphrodite
boon m blown kiss
ok maybe we haven't got any of us that we completed them
is a complete these pizzas already
what we got here
ok we can boost some boom chances
we can gain
3rd Eye
let's have a few more chance of that and yeah let's have a reroll die
give us a chance for
what's upgrade on the next one
if you don't like it
oh good
another x
run that's not good
set alarm 17
the window channel
ok this is
ok
gauges
90s
I don't want closing bonus damage I don't want that definitely don't want that
ok
so I don't actually need to do anything on this run
escape Aziz
but if I want to pick anything up
that doesn't look fun
no definitely not
right I think because we don't need to do anything right now
Oasis
this one's
ok
happy chappy
are we just finished our first escape
you coming just after the first escaped completed
run number 45
that was with the Shield
office completely wrong with the shield with a lot of Doom damage
I'm going to take the Dome damage again because that do damage was solid last time
do not like this gun
unusual thing for me to say
all the weapons in this game
I think it's possibly my least favourite
the other shield had
some serious damage on it
some of the upgrades and nice some of them are a bit rubbish
I know people say it's the speedrun as Weapon of Choice but
I'm not seeing it personally
yeah the 5 grenades upgrade is conical
that was useful the other day when I got it
I haven't got Nectar I have got next to I need to give some to dhamecha I think
I would normally take healthy but I'm going to take Emma to because I need to give her the nectar
ok
temperature is on happy
but she give me a shiny thing
we like shiny thing and Shining is good
the bow is excellent the bow is a fantastic weapon
excellent
we're going to take that one
that stores prophecy
how many Prophets
that's pretty cool I will probably end up sorting out later for different dash but that's pretty cool
ok hey Jimmy how you doing buddy
how you doing
made it all the way to Greece for the first time
Aphrodite I think
how you doing Jimmy
Take That
we are indeed still playing 80s
yes bonus life thank you
we're going to get a key this time
he's are a thing
I'll take the key
there is a shop we'll have a look at that in just a sec
just making sure there's no parts around that we have destroyed
what's in the shop
instant life instant Darkness
an extra card for 16 counters
no will leave those cos I'm gonna want the money for the big shop when we get there
I'm gonna boss
oh good this minibus
that's enough of that thank you
if you kindly go away
will be greatly appreciated
excellent
helpful
what's a synonym for me
I think we'll have a call
what take that call
Encounter
you'll notice we have the demonata thing
that is not what you said when you're right there
sisters handy
I don't need healing
I literally the darkness will take the money
the money will be good
that was not the right place to stand
ok we can boost our doom damage or we can boost our call
having boosting the call is the better option here
that doom damage is good but the call is going to be even better
especially with us boosting you this early
I don't like this country actually Amy's wonky
what's another partner
do something else for doing this time
kettles
ok it's going to be small and he's around here somewhere
what would not be at this time it's going to be gloomy
I heard a noise for chaos I didn't hear no fishing I don't think
no I didn't take us to this
we're going to take the chaos because chaos is always a good chat
Centre health
where are you now
chaos is everything apparently
ok
52 Maxell that is useful
52 Max house
we won't know what we got as options
so we're just going to take an option
it does mean we won't know when there's a shop nearby
which is on helpful that we might accidentally stumble across the shop anyway
ok
I'm gemstones is a good thing to get
Sols health
we don't know what we're going to get this time so will go right
we get an instant area the moon
anthem bonus health
health good
where is Brunel so good
Special Olympics saying we don't use a special that much but I guess that would be handy all the tanks do more damage
Ola taxi more damage definitely
I don't know what this is going to be
probably going to be something hello it's a boss
it's lady murder
I should have guessed that it would be a boss coming up
and delivery not attacking her too much
I want to do exhaust all the parts first
because as soon as you are too much she does this
and does it again
Burberry her down then
that'll be her down
and some Darkness also known as health
and up we go
thank you ksb
and some more House
and lidl Shop
casteels bonus damage
24/6 encounters yeah we're not fussed about that what I do want to do it I didn't remember to do it before it's check it what chemical gives us
ok next moon in Friday from Dumbarton
and we got that where do we get on from I don't know what that one in 1 chance and move speed each time you clear an encounter quickly
that was that
so we've got Meg we've got dusa so there's one character we haven't yet got anything from
and
few characters we need to find yet
we'll get there
I heard a noise that sounded like either a fishing spot or a chaos Spotify think was chaos
getting warmer in what
put it
that was my
TaleSpin clearing and getting up bonus Max health
that's what that was another bonus myself is always good
mormac Celsius
checking for pots
got to destroy all the parts
including that one
ok so we got a key or we've got another one of the nectar
we got a couple more things to get sole of getting on release
call parts indeed.es
came
ok we got one of the truths
what do we get out of this money money is a good thing for us to get
I should check for any more pottery
there's some
ok truth
definitely want the truth for the extra money
90 cash
90 cash is good cash
I'll keep an eye out for this fishing spot as well
that's a tough one Daedalus hammer or a shop
we're going to take the shop just because we got plenty money
the hammer is always a good show
I can do excellent things
as an annoying choice to have to make
Oakwood health
on the plus side
hello
Karen's not her happy
I've never done this before
did I just ruin the shop
I think I made through in the shop
oh good
next robust I wasn't expecting
I was not expecting that
Carly gets a speak
something like that
have you got some very happy I'll be honest
this is just not on
that's a test if I used already
I was not expecting her to fight this guy at all
ok yeah this is not going at all well
athena's kiwi protector Dan alive this is good of her
this is not so good I'm going back to die
apparently I did Willow
hello
20% off
hello
that's new
I did not expect that in so good
no health and a boss fight
I didn't get the bonus from the shop because I took the money first
this is not gonna be a long run
it was always going to end
which is there an annoying boss after deal with
I didn't get anything at the shop but I got 850 goal this is interesting
resist
yes that's good only want the week
not to be confused the weekend
stream Raiders would deal with that in just a sec
and then we got money as our only option with very rich this run
we already have 858 gold
this is the most money we've had on the run so far I think
can we get a discount in future shops
what have I got we have 24-hours on the field
went for a cursed and this time
this is where the enemy is gonna be fighting I think
so let's rock and roll
6424 alloys
we got some serious killing to do if you're gonna get through this
we are getting through it
we are doing some serious killing
there is some serious killing going on
this Lauren and pleasant lot I don't think we're going to get through them unless with very lucky
there are rather a lot of them
my worry is down immediately that's not unexpected
that tank is doing ok but we don't have a lot of Heelys
and some of rdps corded iron quite quickly
ok yeah we got DPS DPS DPS and lots of enemies
we got a couple of Centurions it could be
the Centurions might hold it out
I think they got it I think the Centurions has just about got this
having a go on it
they did it at the end the ksuite with hotspot on the overall most kills
was going out of random TSB pick up couple of healers extra m k picking up a bomber or 2 MPs getting 7 gold and of course those personal chests
a Mrs where if you got those epic units
this is where you want to throw them in we're going in against Mr Mr Whiskers apparently
Mr Whiskers the cat
I've not seen this
huge glitter indeed did have the loan healer
yes it is a kitty extra m b looks like a rather grumpy one
what we go centurion could do some things
I think this is going to be
the DPS diners best we can
I'm going to start my order up here hopefully taking out that rock immediately
and then we can work our way through the rest of it afterwards
yeah if we can be with Mr Whiskers that would be good
will find out
Ronaldo
I have killing to do
and money
even more money
the next shop we come to we're going to be spending plenty
so you're not with the boss when you do a lot of movement this is not the ideal weapon
is movement is not this weapons 40K clearly how you doing

vacation

University coronavirus
so at the moment there are set responses for different commands
it is open to future improvement and change
a lot of the subway to Liberty coded so it
because we can maintain command with night but also DJ can invoke them as well
yes I did granny
indeed I did
we're going to the property
all the proper stuff
that is a bot ksps coded for me
KSP install the back-end code on this
and I believe is calling on some AI assistants from his good lady who is an AI expert
so that is how I believe this is going
Karen is not impressed but you know
what have you got yours in darkness next
something along those lines yes
ok we got multi doom as well
rksv is in excellent programmer
when he sets his mind to it you can do some quite spectacular things with code
we done already

I'm writing this is the initial concept there is a lot more that can and will happen within the future
tell me the dog is more responsible than I am
the dog is employee of the Month
gotta love it
when the dog is employee of the Month
says it all really
when it says the other employees are a little bit rubbish to be fair
we haven't got enough to boost r
legendary or duo chances
what runaway you get this time I'll get a spear on ok
steering for a bit only have done for the longest is oversaw the fists
I do like the sphere
yeah that was the initial idea
ok and again we don't need no heat this time because
too much heat is annoying
ms-dos ms-dos
is a special website I load up which does the voice recognition
and the rest of it is all hosted elsewhere
ms-dos honestly
what decade do you think this is L what decade
badass 6.22 was an awesome less
best of foghorn cast
dos 622 was good
it was the best dos
KS been messing with the back-end
have a burrito
health or money Max health
I didn't really don't worry so just yet
overfeeding gonna want in a minute but you know
bit late for that now
list of this weapon you can stand lock things
Max life thank you very much
anything used around here I've not seen any fishing spots yet
the rubbish
makes you going to tell me you didn't like three 11 for work groups
ok we've got a boon
Scott Flores
3.3 wow
or we got struck deals more damage
yes
damage you deal as a chance to be crit
definitely
because I'm doing a lot more than just normal damage
let's go to the shop
replay expansion guide WoW
I still don't quite have enough money for the Daedalus hammer that's a shame
stabilus anyway
when are the other two
will definitely have that bone herself
I definitely have the darkness
especially when we're going into a boss fight
command line arguments being passed by the app itself well ok
is a minibus not a football that's ok
if we were on the fureys already a bit worried
least I can accept
new take that
unsteady on
yes attack dealing week
I'm wondering if I'm getting attacked out and does a week and an attack does Doom
having both of those together would be awesome
failing at all damaged us doing would be
as well
some more Darkness is good
encountered a character
turbo Pascal while
now calm down Santos
shoulder pushing strategies lovely
and clearly thank you so much for that subscription greatly appreciated
about 5 months in a row now thank you so much but it is great to have you support us that support as always keeping the stream running
thank you so much dude thank you
what's it going to give us
the usual things money
keep the Backstreet going right
I do like the spear for its rapid damage
it feels like a very quick weapon
which is not often said about a spare to be honest
state of the art is the state of the floor I'm worried about
extra top healthiest
and the Phantom there's no use to me
anything fishing within here
no fishing
ok so I can either have a minibus for some Gems where I can have some Darkness without Darkness
is darkness boost my boon rarity later on
don't want to hands get to makers
they will stop me from going anywhere
which is thoroughly unpleasant of them
more than a tad on helpful
have you got a big shop just coming up
and none of that is worth having one there's a big shop here
moba extern yeah
I've seen a lot of people using my brexit
ok so I won't be buying a burrito cos I'll be an absolute waste of money
I think we want the hammer resources is called The Hammers bed
hole yes please Strike It's three times
yes definitely
especially when we going to boss fight
I like Lennie explain my Brixton
I've been loved by user but I haven't used it myself
Towcester getting a keg in
emoting
oh look at that
that is some serious damage this strikes doing
I feel like this is going to be another one of those good runs that I can early with the Shield
if I'm knocking out damage this fast
beyond lost your wallet headache over scaring in can of the red pill anti-vaxxer oh well that sounds like you had a rough day buddy that sounds like you had a rough day indeed
hopefully what you can do now is open a proper beer
and have a bit of a rest
that sounds yeah doesn't sound good at all man
textable 4-star Base All That is positive
that doesn't sound like a good day
if I did that sounds like you've had better days
ok
righty-ho
but take that anyway
because we don't need it
my stupid not to
ok yeah I'm loving this
triple dash strike
what does honey give us
attack is faster
love you hate you have a 15% chance to dodge automatically yes
ok there's a truth there we're going to take that cos
that's Darkness
and darkness is good
yeah OK that was quick
yeah that works
For health so we don't need to worry about all the parts
the gold pots with coloured
around
got a Parmo we got some gold we need some gold
you definitely need some gold
is that shop is coming up and we haven't got much
ok doesn't help over there for when we need it in a minute
but we will
pick that up
deal with the rest of his pots
have a quick look see if there's any fishing spots we didn't see
I'm not seeing any
I'm party does a lot of the stuff I need but yeah I've heard
the shop is awesome but so does the double Boon
I think the double boon is going to be the better shout
don't take the health just yet
double boom followed by chaos wow
talk about a nightmare
ok so the dash strike
we've doing some extra damage as well
order strike with reduced damage
yeah go on without a booster
you can try
ok that hurt a lot
yeah he's passive fog is doing some serious damage I don't think we can have the health of Chaos
yeah we're not going to have a health to deal with chaos as well
Jenny he's happy then
I think will take that because it's stated
what we got in here
we don't have the house
connect 24 health and we've only got next 30/35 that is not
choice
I think taking that chaos would
JCB guaranteeing around death
that is not a sensible approach
take the pub instead

ok more crit damage
different duct tape
there is always docked evolve somewhere
yes there is let's do some fishing
let's do some fishing
that is 3 m
nice a crustacean
I can't read that into some stuff
so that is 3 m it is time we do that we have a cat to kill
and we have 32 arrows on the field
I think we want to put a curse alright on this cat
Paddy is going to be the one to kill
32 hours on the field
let's rock and roll
to take that Rock
that cat is doing a lot of damage very quickly
my cat is taking a photo damage as well but it's doing a lot of damage
what is that cat taking damage yes it is
what what is the cat doing
what on earth is a cat doing
did the cat run away or did we kill it
America killed the cat
extra metrical nice job
you killed the cat now it just got to do with loads of ants
and The Beatles
what you got John Paul left
vacation
we got the Ants and the Toad
yeah moba extern is well worth looking at KFC
I don't use it myself but I know people who swear by it
shock Elise taking all of those top spot as the most kills with 13 most assists with a and the overall top spot
shouting you've won you have a guarantee reward you have got a berserker scroll all you got a Centurions grow
going to chat letters now tell us which one of these two rewards you want
always I have to pick one for you at random
that's a point KSP do we have any kind of dice command or anything like that for a random draw
that would be a handy thing
having some sort of random
one two or three types thing on one or two thing
actors that be awesome things like this situation where I don't think Schalke Lisa's in chat hopefully is and if he is he'll come and tell us which of these rules you want but if not then we can pick one at random with something like that
so that might be something we want to at some point
for 6 to do later
if you don't hear from shackles shortly I will throw a rewarder
yeah one B60 something and then we can just do one two three on the A406 on Friday or something
I could be handy
totally it won't just be a role like that it'll be voice activated
it'll be a voice command that will mean that I don't have to push my buttons to make it happen because that's what we want is something that I don't have to push buttons to make happen you know where is playing you to stay safe and I think it's actually is going to get that berserker
hang on we got a dice command
the six thank you very much that means the Centurion go to shock Elise there we go
excellent so they're all going around an extra metre can pick it up berserker scroll
every else
gold I get Three Musketeers
and we defeated the boss the kitty is no more
and we've got a skin chest at the top here so we're going to take you stop Road
go to the book worms
another word for Musketeers
but the shower is called The Three Musketeers
a lot more than 4
they were Holden group of them
no I think we're still on the o nowhere on place Busters
the fastest I can do
Fosters I can definitely do there is a Buster
there is one of three buses
excellent let's with checker quests

and it still works
she totally the box got some intelligence to it
well said extra matrica well said indeed
we like this but this body part
next to start talking about your Chinese takeaway toastie
and you will get to that when we get to it but right now we're going back to Hades
very expensive I think the answers that case be very expensive indeed
Poseidon or Aphrodite
design
what see the problem is that no change is based on region
the cost of a submarine now different in different places
I knew that was going to happen eventually I knew somebody were coming with a mum joke
swallows rules of the internet
eventually happen of the longer you wait the more likely is for something to come in
that is a good point I've forgotten we will follow her only
I've forgotten the chat done like that we were because we had a problem with a bottle of the day or something
and it was a bottle turned up they shouldn't have done or something and
I see why worry in follower only mode
it was a bottle of some sort that was being annoying
yes spambots that's right not many we need one or two but we had one or two
60% bonus reward yes
especially when we're going into

any chance we're not sure it needs that much power but there is a chance we might teach about a function
and with great power comes great responsibility
oh yes something like that toasty
we have a cunning plan about how that could work safely and still have a kill switch that means it can't go absolutely crazy and banned the entire chat
I knew could
whether by sin to do or not I'm not sure
but you know there's some really cool things
in the making here
we're definitely having a shop because
the Maxwell to be useful we haven't got a lot of bass self at the mo
and the shop we don't have to have a fight and can get some help back usually
we have enough for all the things
yes will have a call because we haven't got a call yet
I will have a pump
which upgraded Heartbreaker strike
yeah text always been fine
the problem with tax tool is that they are now finding ways to work around that
it's going to be a case of him updating things as it happens but it works great
I think the things we discussed in the other day
I think that would work pretty well for it to be fair
we'll have to think about that in more detail later
I think that plan that you had
I think that would be an excellent way of doing it
there's a few things that we could throw in
my bottom and a lot of this Cruiser go on the stream that I've got in front of me as well I've got a few spare buttons on here
and part of what the box can do is replace
bottles of red Eagle
so it's going to save us some hassle
level as well
I guess I got Max house now but no justify is left
I got hope for the encounter on
the next round
we get the encounter we can get all of my debt advisor replenished
what we got in the shop
nothing useful
no money anyway
yes are many options
many things we can do
I want the money
show me the money
I know there's a burrito at the start I haven't picked up deliberately
yes I want to take it now
now that I've got
the fight over with
camera house
but I can hammer
I'm doing some keys
what's the weather right keys on another matter entirely up for debate
I know I could take that burrito
but I can also for to wait till the end of the fight for it
this hammer is excellent
we need the Prophecy
I'm off anymore no
money or shops
yeah you'd hope he was good after this song
no money
a golden Pot
we have
enough for the max life
and the moon
weak effects no longer have a duration
interesting
and some more maxlife please
yeah I'll take them out life was a little shop got in it
being wasteful up to 63
when I checked the Little Shop just in case but
there's no point me any money on someone's going to go way over the top
especially when I'm short on money
post office verify how much money is involved
very valid thing to say
Waverley policy to hold
I suspect they also vary based on how funny is
something fun then I suspect you throw a bit more into it
is mundane stuff that nobody is interested in
ok and I'll work
I'm not sure the canal bookies
but I seem is a very important one
yes I've got money
ok
what is normally Moss
take that as well
what is going on around here
a good witches
am I good I mean not at all
ok what are we boost
kernighan and Ritchie
the fridge invented sea and he was part of the book about it I totally understand why that's an important book I really should have
early upgrade
I think we upgrade the week
duration
there we go for the moon
the first one is seen this run
merani
well that went down very quickly
poorly written season nightmare
willow
hello duo
will take that you open
Nova and weak stack together very nice
Darkness or
Victor
is darkness is also healthy
iPhone XR
I'm going to one house
look at my current amount offered not match
my current amount of testifies I not many
the waste of a good gauge
ok yeah that's not going well
here's hoping that we get the character Encounter
I'll come along
are we got butterflies
I dislike butterflies butterflies are annoying
the butterfly also very annoying
article gives a bit of health but not enough
we haven't got an incredible we have got a shop
Hollywood health in the shop
any more Health over here
I'm going into a boss fight
I think it's a solid option to buy the health
and the moon
oh yes please
and yes I will take
pressure point boost
this is not going to go well we have no testifies on we're going up against the mine at all
this is going to end in their favour
I will give it a go
that's not very polite
yeah we have not got a lot of health there
and Theseus has this annoying ability to
play city block pre-match anything I throw at him
annoyingly the monitor was impossible there
I need to get this dog gates charged
yeah back to hell is exactly where we going
Kiki
what back
will the winner get telephone we had no death 24-hours
and none else
well I was going on here
near
I'm sure you're not in that much
after all
you have a nice number one next to your name
number one in a gift box
make no sense secrets
the story gets deeper
hello dusa
ok let's give him some fish
kattegat day
he just commented about his ministry to Chamber so we should actually go there
you know cos I'm sure there's something interesting going on
not well
also not well
I think I know why we are in here
we are trying upset in my betting office out
that does seem cheap
yeah send me a message
it is limited to one spur
streamline
so any one person can redeem a stream
runaway going to do this time
we're going to do
I do like this weapon
this is definitely one of the better weapons in the game
ok yeah we don't need any heating audible to do
this run
we won't need more heat until
we get all the way out with it
do a shield around we got
but we aren't doing she would run so we're ok
check
what are we going to take this time
attack and deflect
sasti flight is by far the best choice
the best Ash in the game of relief
there's no fishing spots in here now
awesome you need to keep an eye on Boris fishing spots

there is some help I need
the burrito that knows me knows I didn't need
and there's no fishing shop fishing spots Ian
I don't believe that sufficient spot it's not
Andy shop
I like a shot me
I do like a shop
let's definitely have some Max held up
and let's have some Darkness
we could try but he wouldn't less
ok we're going to my boss
minibus we can handle
I don't think I've seen this many boss before though
no I have
Batman
ridiculously quickly
I was not much for mini boss
and any damage has a chance to be critical yes
kiesel Darkness Darkness
I've got keys and I need more Darkness
is that charged shot takes a while but
damages multiple enemies on hit them
and damage is a lot
I take water damage as well but you know
ok yes we're taking the double Boon
as we be daft not to
under the trophy as well for later
so we're not going to pick up any help that we find at the moment
we're gonna market or find it at least
there isn't any health that's not ideal
yeah let's take Artemis first
15% chance to crit on attack
10% chance to deal crit on a cast
or marking a favour sure
bonus attack damage always
there's rat and then there's rats
oh good she's angry so she shield in all the enemies
that's ok then
if you could maybe stop being
quite so she ordered
ok she's officially a nuisance to deal with
she's definitely going down on my list of people who are a pain
this is definitely looking bad
that trump did not do me any favours
which I guess is a kind of the point of traps
I will take that
I'm learning on their own
that we useful
money
money
I need it
what is the speed thing
I got 52 gold at that
32 gold is still worthwhile especially going into a shop
play wicker man how you doing
we have excellent news
I completed One run tonight
I first ever completion
yeah it was a hectic one
shield run it was the one from yesterday that we were doing the Shield where we have all the bonus doing everything
I'm talking of Doom
Doom
special does Doom
yes it was
sadly this is always going to be a bit off
adaptaflex does help quite a bit
especially when she does things like that
starships mizu sitting her back which helps
Zeus very handyman to know
this is very very handy man tonight
wow
talk about a la second safe
that was a ridiculous
yeah well the spinning blades of death were kind of a problem
Ballymoney no 72 no point looking at the shop
and you're nova.tv welcome greatest here thank you so much other how you doing this evening
how do you find us
getting a drinking as well very good idea indeed
came from the Alienware so very nice
do I know you want there if you kept quiet and we spoken before
is not everyone has the same name into different places but it is great to see you
welcome to my little corner of the internet
just chilling on the server that's all good all good
I don't know they wouldn't be here that is
I'm not sure that's quite the right way to say thanks but you know
you will cost a recognise Wicker Man
it's all good
it's all good don't worry
I won't be any mistakes and this is me making them
from Brazil very nice
as far as I'm concerned everybody's welcome here
have you seen Hades before do you know the game
so goodnight all good
don't worry 4:30 people on the channel can't I buy there I know I can't
and I certainly can't type
what we got then
apart from an exploding bomb
animal health Fox
oh dear Rick so dear
right we can either take maxhealth up or we can go to boon I think we're going to take the max health
actually I don't think will I writing of any sort of here
Elise which is do not like the fact that my bo can basically take out all their projectiles
as long as I take them out before they hit me
like that
which is essentially useless
take that Max Burns night that was a chaos sound
I don't know unhealthy chaos but that was definitely chaos sound
24 ok we have got herself because we got 124
so we can afford to be that 100
football anyway
it will take that burrito for some bone herself
thank you chaos
what is Chaos going to give us today
plus 116% damage driving from behind
having the same food drop like I have them juices charm saying at Max
deuces chomping at Max is very very handy
near the middle is good
I'm also looking about bonus damage
I think the middle because we know Darkness is out for me
I want I want the one azusa do when an Aries
we had both so far
I think will take an Aries and I see a wicker man who's just loaded of Hades
I see somebody who sir
buy the bug
how good will this is the one where you on Tuesday special anyway
you don't use special here you get demolished
where is if you do you special especially with a booster damaged I think my special rockin'
yeah that hurt
and I've definitely KFC
Aries is feeling generous today
hello
attacks special and car steal more damage yes
especially when it's epic
I'll take that burritos Omagh
is he the reason I'm getting too many food drops as I am
is because I'm running
this
broken bones have a 6% chance
yeah know where she never it's great to see
next time you're more than welcome anytime you like
exclamation schedule will get you the schedule for when we string
hope to see you next time
mediastream four nights a week every week so
Lenny a time to come back
there's another one for the bottle as well KSP
window eystreem
or what is the stream schedule
I was going to get upset about my pronunciation of schedule
we know that is going to get upset with that
with when do we stream or something like that
ok so we've got Darkness we got gemzar we got Nectar
that is fine with schedule ok
that's good
going to take the darkness because even in the gym to be nice a minibus this is not
sanitise
hello
test detect your neighbours km
I always said that you were lucky mad
these things are annoying
I'll take that
I'll take that as well thank you

there we go
I was not mumbling it was just deaf
want to move out of Russia
I I follow you doing
right
I can't afford both of these but I think the random Boon
worthwhile
are we getting azusa ok
yeah do we have
yes we do sorry time I take damage
can you get struck by lightning anyway
I think we therefore want and also be altered
especially since we're off to deal with the Hydra
Millennium bone hydra
who is getting more and more grumpy by the day
I do like how quickly this boat rides the Hydra
I mean shred
I look at that that is serious damage
none of the death defy that is annoying
have to dash device
OK that is not the way I wanted you to go
shouldn't have had a second testify in there
hiya my health bar was there but to be fair
there was no easy way to get through that anyway
I had to just keep fighting
cousin Marvin I don't think I've got a cousin Marvin
I haven't got enough money for the thing that's not there anyway
do the damage
the thing is if I was further away most of those spread shots would not hit anything
the way to actually shred that quickly is to take the damage and just soak it up
the problem is I was soaking up call you love it
take the family
you bleed on your phone too much they can train
that too can happen
but then I also had the
everytime he hits me
he takes more lightning damage
so
very damaged tanking rotten
because all the tank and also
use more DPS
there is a strategy of sorts here
oh nice
special deals three base damage for each consecutive hit yes
especially is good
if we thought that was going to do serious damage before it's going to do it you're more now
needn't get a single hit in anywhere
yes without bonuses even wash reading going on
more shredded than Shredded Wheat
bnova Stanmore give me didn't get a single hit on there
you just sat there getting upset
I will take the shop
definitely take the shop
right
we can't have both the bones because you don't have enough
let's take a speed Boon
bonus tax charge
would be useful
chance to dodge so definitely chance to Dutch
I'll take the gemstones as well because gemstones
I would like the Hamel it's not on a bus
things blocking a bunch of our attacks
he can't block of the Athena
shield hits
bloody stream Raiders
what day was on just a moment
so you can't block me Athena hits nails I can't block this damage
which is good because this is exactly what I have to deal with the thesis later as well
my health bar is looking very bad I know
what are we going to have
old special for up to 50% base damage minimum range reduced
ok
what Take That
oh that's ridiculous
that is ridiculous and good
truth for gold
what is a shotgun in Italy
I don't think we want to take the truth at this point
because we're already so no one else that
I think we only just take this next Maxwell or health up
before we do that we do want to do stream Raiders
otherwise I'm going to have problems there
so what are we looking at this time
over here
I want ship Miller unit so let's give them a melee spell
and with 28 hours on the field let's rock and roll
want to 126 on Ice this shouldn't be too bad we should have this
because at least one then we're good
Halo 2 that are coming out with romance but that's ok
there's not a lot of them we got this covered
I think we've easily got this covered
10 enemies left now
she's looking much more sensible
much much much more sensible
there we go just a couple left to kill
double events in a couple of worms
I think that's the wrong thing is that us
they're not gonna last we've got this
with absolutely got this k-speed annoying denying I frog the trifecta
I stopped taking the most kills and the top sport ksb taking the most assists
water random tears me picking up 3rd Scrolls extra much picking up 15 gold and biscuits 5 I get 3 and of course loads personal chests
now we want to take this stop route
because we want to get that loyalty skint
the only way to get there
are we one unit welling
he's going to do some damage
that's kind of what I pick units to talk talking about units
please play say Buster ladies my Buster
that is going right there
I need that for my quest talking requests I have to quest to hand in
Andy knows Quest
12:10 yes please that's an upgrade
they will do nicely as well
let's take those upgrades on the flag bearer
and if I can find him on the Templar
what a close quite happily
we'll see that there in half an hour's time
innovo
got a fight together
and some Healthcare light switches
just at the right moment there
that was a last testify
that was incredibly bad for us
yeah this is not going well
definitely not going to make it to see this right
if we do I don't think we stand much of a chance of a win on that anyway
quite the character in Gangsta
at this point of character in Council be very useful indeed
we're going to get a character Encounter
Mrs probably going to kill us
escape the balloon anyway
yeah this is not going well
I'm going to sleep that's deflecting as I think this pointless
taken out by a trap
taken out by a trap
you know I want no worries at all
are we knew that even with all the damage you are doing that was not very good one
I'm still impressed the Shield was my best weapon so far
always always always put the dog
always pet dog
also obvious want this done
ok
that is looking reasonable or we got
next one
friendly rivalry
somebody write that down
that is a line that needs to be reused again in the future
definitely line that needs to be review used in the future
Achilles gave us the book of course
the dog is cute
Joe Weller
very happy anyway
so we got a new tempo
the permanent record hasn't changed that's fine
we can be inspirational
we need to get what ever put the story is unlocked phone in the contractor think
is that allowed to annoy people
oh hello
I've not had a chance to give him one of the year
that's annoying I was hoping that will be one of the ones that I needed to fill in the list with
Lisa makes a way around
you might say in here now
you got enough don't miss for another couple of weeks
has boost this percentage with more
higher the percentage of the better
ok we got another shield around the bonus Darkness
the Shield is solid
however this now means that we need
some heat in order to be able to do this again
9 minutes to clear each region
next
your choice is not ideal ignore initial damage one hit her prank
which mini boxing can connect plus one Ahmed Folsom edition problem
I think to be honest this
that would do
yeah that will do
we can take that
take a 9 minute deadline per region
going to be quicker on this
attack deflect
well we know which one of these gonna take it's going to be daft deflect
immediately take chaos
yeah we do that
yeah
animes hello
goodnight
gems
we need enough for the house contractor
I'm so not that thank you
we don't need anything else money
this is the speedrun of not speedrunning
my 9 minutes of region should be easily doable
having a something like 10 or 12-in counters and none of them take a minute each
I'm good
I forgot what that gives us but it's going to be something good
ok we got minibus
what have we got on the minibus
minibus the mini-boss
how we got these two
we don't deal with many bosses
so she gives a full size buses
what we got then
the meant always good
but Aphrodite's aid we could do with an eight we don't always get one
let's get straight to it
didn't really need that but I will
you know weapons overpowered when I'm looking at health and going didn't really need that
defensive weapon it's only dishes out a lot of damage
ok auctions ihotel for health what have we got in the shop
let's not have any that
straight for the house
ok again I didn't want to take that just yet but it's a bit late now
and she was a very rapid fire movement weapon
fishing spot
Halifax if you do see anything you're a clip for your 32
and don't move clips in discord
let's have a quick fish
which doesn't appear to affect the time arrival
shop yes please
went too soon on the fish
ok well we don't need the house
that's booster
come on what are we having this time
and a hammer
the last time I Had a Hammer on this it may be incredibly overpowered
here's hoping for the same again
this is a solid weapon anyway
in every sense of the word
ok yeah that's the one we like from before
double hits
no not quite the double hits
we could do that
did keep dancing on the Year things that
yeah there's definitely true there
definitely do that drive
I heard my chaos in evolve
the new Ko sing open
the questions with Max health so we take chaos
although we take the shop
Witcher chaos
yeah we'll have rarer balloons
I will still have a shop
so we definitely not buying the house that will buy the max Elsa
or maybe we'll just buy video
I was a better show
apparently we've not done this
fossil the Shield before
ok but because we got heat on it
we get another blood out of it
sorry mate it's not happening this time I'm afraid
much as you wanted to it's not happening
sorry mate no chance
you can try but it just ain't gonna work
take another time blood
set a timer to get 1 per sheet level 1
that's useful to know
we could have the extra life
always have the extra treasure
escape the trailer
we need 500 treasure
ok
Good Food
but we don't know if it's good food or nobody's food
On food is my definition good
we're going with
that wasn't very nice of him
invisible rito at least
Take That
tahira fishing spot
I can't tell her official spot or not
no I didn't
we got there we got a key you're some Darkness
Darkness
I want to get this
excellent we got the chaos boost
we'll have this
will definitely have this this is
South a very rapid runs so we should get quite a lot with health back with this
87 healthiest please
wouldn't need half of that but
I'll take it
ok Paul Maura boon definitely Boon
this is very definitely at rapid run
I think the only
computational like more than this one
the sword mutation gives you health
every hit gives you like to help back or something
come on then
that's another health dropped I don't really need at this point
which kind of seem to be saying
take it anyway cos
Yellow self drop
what is Artemis going to give us
specialist stronger ka6 photos
any damage chance to crit death by crit damage
has anyone option you take at least who wants to shop
we love a good shop
ok even though we can't afford anything in the shop
missile take the shop
because the shop means we don't have to have a fight there
miss time
how good the Barge
I prefer the Bosch you can't fall off of it and into the lava
if you can't fall into the lava and you don't take lava damage
I'm loving seeing Eugene is going down by the way folks keep that on
keep up the good work
what time is it going to get this time
what we got
war we got
we have a weiner
oh that'll do nicely
one on the Facebook list as well
and it just means I've got to use my ear spell
the chaos there which we can't go into
just yet
tk maxx light up is good
Tony of Life of we got anymore
history murders
ok so we got a choice going to shopping health up or we got chaos
history medicine and come back and work it out
have you got the last battle of the night we have
a nice healthy 35 units on the field
asteroid in the middle of their and let's Get It Started let's rock and roll
lots of things that kill lots of things being killed
Renfrew it's going down
I'm loving the look at this desk going on
the Archers are going to do a good job on the answer the top of hope
they might
they might get them all they did
calculator
ksb taking the most kills antiviral talkSPORT but chaka leaves taken the most assists
random extra magical getting a Musketeer boy from getting a couple of months where can I get a couple of flying Rogues ml67 gold cost 20 for me and those personal chests
and we will do some more streamers on the next stream
an extreme of course being Saturday so we'll see that in a bit
got ages around the carry on with
take the shop
does the least damage to us
we normally take chaos but
in this situation the shop seems like a viable option
take that out from it
what are we going to have
I can't afford both of these
that Max else is growing why is it growing
take the max health
Max of ok and we got a new diamond because
here again the first time with each gauge
he's not very happy
ok out come the heads
come on then
OK he's going to bring out all of his head's
and it doesn't matter have a gauge Richard did I was going to be surprised
I was saving it for when I'm back on the main Bosley
a lot of lava hair
there's a lot of Lawlor here
come on
yes she wasn't having any of that
call Lorena Moxon instant finisher yes please
what Take That
instant Furniture job done
tomorrow we got here again no money nothing worth having
at least I'm straight into the next bit
I got a few minutes more
and take that house
take that Darkness cos that is also health
and they're not back this does handy
the double Hitler much better
especially when combined with the dash trike
edges shreds everything
maxwells
myself
what I didn't realise it seems that is the case
didn't realise that any left over time transfers
I've got a reset to 9 minutes each time role than
turn over
alright the shop is
car pointless
this shop however will be pretty pointless but worthwhile
it's a free encounter with some free food
looks like a baboon
where we go
resist from damage
houses of wide short-range yes because we need to be using cast anyway I will keep forgetting to
look and we can be annoying
borrow 300 gold
excellent we can fight Karen again
not the internet drop
where are you in a few minutes
I've just yet there's a rain coming up shortly
gentleman
grabbing apple
barna
this is entirely reasonable
this wine is Aurora
is getting his earring
specified yet
is very grumpy the sky
it's almost time
another loyalty card
another loyalty card hurrah
only cost us two
suffice
a small price to pay for
cheaper shopping
oh good lots and lots of butterflies
and witches
we don't like either butterflies all witches
a nuisance
I also don't like dying really
what Take That
what is he going to office
another one on the fight list
and at that point
it is not tell him
it is that time where we keep the music
because we only go for that rate
would you like to do a raid would you like to support people
this
as always I will be back Saturday
we ought to go for a ride first light
KSP has the option
resources option
so we got a few options here
who are we going to go for
I think we are
got to go and check out
what are the friends of the Stream
it is indeed federal ghosts
because I see poppy on the stream at the moment
and everybody loves
seeing puppies on the street
so you can see that I will see you again Friday for the Waffle
the next room
silver no stay safe
stick around for that rate
I'll see you soon

III how you doing
happy Saturday to everybody
how you doing a cat
yeah that's about right ASB that sounds about right a dwarf how you doing good to see you buddy
which one of these will be shooting which one in the foot
I probably need to speak to my graphic designer and AV engineer on that one a mistake as B74
you have words of him about that
but I can't really go advertising Cambridge 105 Radio because this isn't an official advertisement for them and therefore I shouldn't really be linking this stream with them
I think that I just think I can't exactly think this stream is an official advert because it isn't
sanctioned by the bossy might not be too happy
I'm doing well you how about you buddy
were you impressed with the shape of our Rideout route Aaliyah
every bankline how you doing great to see you
I'm glad you liked it
is 1BB shooting in the foot tonight
are we gonna stick a shooting near me
mod Hades
countdown KFC campaign
anyway we'll pick up some stream Motors
spy is the enemy
maybe dwarf Freudian slip
do kick off some Street Motors Wigan run this as a waste
started off what question we got today
kill ranged units event tokens kill up academies get unity level 20 get us level 20 we can do let's put a centurion down
looks on my centurion nicely
for this so I put him just there
let's take that home
and let's head straight into Hades
we have the appropriate noise everything
SMS on my engineering team make the Script work properly isn't it
I guess it's close enough
so you got the Lyceum last time
using
ok
oh yes it is eternal truth here
restore up to 125 health yes I think we'll do that
I know you got a minute or 9 minute timer on getting to the next area
if I got chance for an extra 125 health I'm going to take that
Arriva child's half that
65 Althea Will Take That
65-in herself is a lot more than we had before we started that
choice of money or any more money
my boss bad me but very bad
a frame Wheels also bad mini-boss worse
berita berita good
oh no butterflies we just like butterflies butterflies are a nuisance
unshielded y01 shielded
could you please not be
why are all these things in shielded
is the blue thing she would in them
Liberty's they need to stop that as well
explain wheels that can explode on Impact
and with a close combat with another she was a little bit difficult to destroy them
my penis that helps a bit with the floating things
more money or Max health Max health I think we want
is may not be the correct run this may not be a winning run
we're going to hit this weekend
high-speed antics vs Dante
are you getting 9 minutes per region
when you end the region it adds another 9 minutes rather than just take me back to 9 minutes
so it's not just 9 minutes we had a little longer on this one
yeah essentially
the longer I take him 1-hour
the last time I get my next one
I totally how you doing
wealden that's all I see nicely done
good to see you tonight

babies worth checking out always excellent to see
how are you doing tonight dude
the string go well
reply the boys well you've now seen the voice but
so DJ tell chart a joke
that's not a joke liver
mumbling as usual rubbish is this
I think we need to tweak the voice recognition slightly later
that or it's just got bad attitude
dwarf least things are boomers
the spoons are gifts from one of the Gods
you find any of these club you'll be thanks
and when you finally you'll be think
you talk to it and one of the gods gives you a baboon or power up
the diagnosis give me a choice of 3
I can have an attacks inflict hangover which was quite cool I can have a castle orbs and explosive that creates festive fog which is also quite cool
or I can have a dash little his hangover attack hangover is a good one

there's a legal joke for you
that was an enemy we have any encounters we have to kill the enemies
and JP Rocky thank you so much for that subscription
go to the vip club great having a thank you as always for supporting the stream keeping everything running
you get yourself a nice shiny green name on discord
who wrote the jokes of the book KSP
Iceland in Tritton
the body jokes
so close JP welcome you get that cool green name on discord you'll get access to the VIP area and of course you get as a most views anyway you're like on Twitch
important thank you as always for keeping the string running and painful
and I get to see you
so dwarf we've got an option here of going through the room give you money or the room that give you a Poseidon Boon
so we can kind of work out whether we can get a power of older we want money now
is very useful for the shops that come later on each level
power-ups obviously I'll power-ups which are Gonna Call
are peas the useful call here
although the shop later on probably officer power as well anyway but also gives us health and things
so get out of the room with power up you don't know what's behind each door
just know what the reward will be at the end
and I'm running around with a pair of oversized knuckle dusters which is what I'm doing a lot of punching
and Jackie getting a coke in immediately
so we get Poseidon power up
I'm a bit what thing at you
ok so what have we got
this guy is quite good for getting
rewards actually that's a very valid one to have
because any gems dark me some money is worth 50% more yes please
hot tight
and with all those jokes are bad
we get to watch and see we can I have some Darkness which helps us expander mirror my organic e which Elvis do things but keys I kind of don't need a moment so we can take the darkness
because while Darkness health Darkness is also upgrade to our permanent
I didn't need to take that burrito while we were stood in the wrong place
so anyway
just gonna smack these guys until they die like that
play The Darkness
I'm gonna break the point anyway cos sometimes these parts also contain money although the one with money intend to be golden in colour
so we getting a diagnosis moon
yeah so the movement is pretty rapid but that's mostly because I'm playing a very fast set
the first Sara weapon where you need to move around you need to be in close proximity and you can basically do a 6 punch combo
some weapons you can stand pretty still
and you can hit from a distance
the other weapons you can't have to be faster
welcome back GP
so we're having a heavy Dionysus run this time this is the third time you've offered something
what are we going to take
I like after party after party is a decent thing love always got least
30% health when I go into Encounter
that is a very valid what I'm doing case we actually running a combo which is the dash and strike so you dash button on its own just makes you rotten and ustrike button on its own makes you punch things
if you dash strike
you get into there and you at the same time
you got enemies
summer head of you you want to be running and hitting them
now these options we can have a fight with some Darkness at the end of it or we can have a shop now shops and never have a fight
so we always take shop on a kettle that you don't have to do a fight
straighten you get to go shopping
and the first thing we do is we smashed all the parts to see if there's any spare money in any of them
there isn't
we don't need the darkness here
but we have a choice between a Max health increase which is this sent to heart
or a random boon and we don't know what it is cos inside of back
the max health increase because help is always a good policy and
because we can't afford both if you look down the bottom right you can see we've only got 22 money's now so we can't afford anything else
we are going into a battle for money
yeah all good all good
I know you love case please mate
so yeah it's it's rapid fire but that's mostly because the weapon I'm using at the time
dash right combo is
basically combo designed for
in the combat and getting out of it again
I getting into fights and doing the Killing before anything is you

but everything went into letter
Anika solicitor has a skull with a little flag this means it's a boss fight
usually this means is a minibus because it's not a full height School full height flag brother
the little B minibus b
yep
throw things at you things which are annoying
and do quite a lot of damage like that
you don't want to be said where the things are going to land
so we take the Boom that we get as a result of the boss fight
Athena is a very good person to give you Burns
each God has a different
and divine dash is always the right choice to take from the singer if it's offered
is dash dealing damage and deflecting
means
I can just run into things with it now and destroy them
also if spells and things hit me
reflected back if I'm dashing at the time and therefore they don't do any damage to me
very important especially when you got some enemies are armored and someone and you need to using their own damage against them
I'll see this is a red Chamber this means there's a time to fight
the top that you see survivor 45 seconds
so I can't just kill everything because more stuff will always come
sorry I should have to keep myself alive
for 45 seconds
and kill as many things as I can in that time
how to stop myself being overwhelmed and dead
haberdashery is my moving around
that's why it's moving quite quickly
another 5 seconds to survive
survived it
dating Darkness out of
an 18 Darkness also gives me 11 hours because of my health perk
so we check these cos somebody's pots contain help burritos none of these do this time
I have a choice we can have an Athena Boon
choice
in or on the scene
a chicken from a well-known company with 3 letters
KFC can't find the chicken
they couldn't the other week they rannachan
how do you speak squares are traps
stand on the nasty things happen
you don't understand on the traps
should you make the sauce 20 minutes and do it YouTube tutorial you could do
the special type of June which is given to you when you got Boons from two different gods that meet a certain list
you get a combined bone
in this case is a Dionysus of Finer
so you only get it
if you were
basically have the right prerequisites
so we're gonna take this one because duo balloons are excellent and because it's got a little scroll just to the left of the name
as I haven't had it before it's on the fated list so that takes off another objective as well
going to take that projectile speed reduction is always sensible means think can't hit me as quickly
take that burrito as well now we got a mini shot here
but we are not exactly flush with cash
so we're not going to take any more stuff this year
that's handy
is all limited time anyway again we don't need the key so much we do need the darkness witches
so what the heck is happening
well you know it gives you some
as I said list weapons very fast weapon which is why moving around quite a lot of wipes
possibly a little bit tricky but with that's what happens if you step on a tramp like that is the Trap thing shoots lots of hours that you and you don't like me and my dick
so somebody's enemies are slightly stronger than others
is all their deflected that's cos I dashed when I was being hit
yeah Panthers put pictures in the
in the discord food and drink chat
in case we wants to exclamation permit for you
eternal truths
eternal truth does is it
is the room for a kill everything as fast as you can fight
you do that fight
you get to the end of it and it comes down so it's not 225 gold it the long you take the kill appreciating the less gold you get
so when I try this
you see there's a countdown at the top left I'll come in and I can't we have any enemies left waiting to be killed
if you watch the money on the counter there
that's going down quite rapidly
the longer I take to kill everything
the less money I'm going to get
can I cure everything quite quickly there
so I got 101 of the 125 gold
hey Jimmy how you doing great to see you happy Saturday
we took the truth because with these fists weapons and you move very fast and you kill things incredibly quickly
so it's absolutely valeting to do to take the true on this
this next one is gems and gems are important for upgrading the House of Hades
so we know what you'll get a general ward at the end of it
and we got lots of these crystals which are
what are the irritating animes to do with
that golden Pot they have some money it
you see this burrito sitting at the top there that is 10 health
need it just yet but will grab it when we do
over grab it when I go past it
it was really low on health I will be focusing on that first
what is Purple balls flew back at the Enemy of through at me because I'm attached into it
and with the dash to flights which is this yellow
she'll be running around me it's sending right back where it came from
also it looks kinda things so these lumps
used to bring part of the ceiling down on
which kills them even better
but we're not going to jump into the next shop yet
because it's this time
will be about 30 seconds
mystery Motors
that's good number of units on the field
15 seconds until I can place my spell
but we have 18 hours 18 hours is good we forgot to place more you hits
that is fine very totally fine
we got over here let's have a quick look and we got an epic vampire that's always handy we got a balloon Buster
I got an artillery unit that's going to do some serious damage
female units we've got a couple of ranged units I think overall what we want is basically I hate spell on this lot to get them as far and fast as we can
so with 19 hours on the field
let's rock and roll
reply to do what pan supports
this game is entirely free to play
play anything by 3 m
stream Raiders completely free to play
actually there's lots of killing going on here
you don't have to pay to play stream Raiders at all
you can pay for the upgraded rewards track if you choose to and you can pay for skins if you wish to but you can play this game absolutely free without spending a penny on it
talking playing a game for free off-road plays for free and easy on yourself 21 kills 9 assists to the overall top spot he has taken all three of those spots
right should have told you to be able to pay to get troops that's very weird
this is very definitely not a pay-to-play game if it was I wouldn't be featuring it on the screen
you should be able to use your existing troops you already got and then when you get together but you will look some more
so start with it completely free and drop units 1 every 5 minutes
and we'll get you through it
and as you know in this dream if you take the number one spot the most cool and most assists
you are guaranteed reward so this goes to work otherwise there was got a random you should get the tank and The Archer Just For logging in with the twitch login
yes I thought you can have the scroll you have a choice of the Palatine squirrel to handle
you get the strap
gold and I get 15 and of course you get your personal chests
so when you go back to the map we're going to open up the next battle
what you want to do that if you want hit the links as a bad to turn up in chat right now and that will take you straight in and link you to me as your captain
you'll be able to play along this
we are going for
level 20
yeah I hit the link see what happens with that we're gonna throw a warrior down
for a worry down right about here
so let's see some unit down on the field we will see this in half an hour
indeed we got a choice of a paladin solar panel Instagram
there was £1 install to choose from
it was a very difficult choice room Jamaica thing
so we got half an hour will see that again in a bit
back to Hades and the decision here is do I want to do a fight and get some Max health up
I want to go to a shop and not do a fight and therefore not take any damage
and the obvious answer is to go to the shop every single time
I mean get the burrito at the pot anyway
see we could pay 50 for some health but we don't need a burrito and chips because we've just got ourselves to full help anyway
pomegranate which is a pomelo
which give you an upgrade on one of your abilities
in this case will take The Hangover upgrade because that does more damage
and we're gonna take the moon as well because we still got 363 gold so we can afford both
what is she going to give us she give us a choice of special dealing more damage and inflicting weak
casting a wide short range blast inflict week
or reduce damage from photos
I think reduced damage from photos is a very wise thing to have
yeah a lot of them do dwarf
Amazon photos good for cost being a wide short-range blast is kinda cool
because we take a lot of damage
especially with this weapon which is basically running and hit them type weapon
I see you got the school here again this time I've got the full height ribbon with the star on top of that means this is the final boss of this area
so what you going here we're going to take on the first boss
and we got a choice of three Fury sisters
we've ended up to Sicily
she doesn't say a lot to Sydney
murder murder murder
and you get the cool boss fight music
and she immediately hits as hard
no things to Sicily
is that everytime you damage her more than a certain amount the room changes
smaller so you want to skate around the room go find the Pops first
you so avoid these things on the floor and then give you a good clobbering
and the more you hit her the more upset she gets and then she does that
ring get smaller so now we run around we check the parts again check for more health
there isn't any more health that's ok so now we just beat her up a bit
this is the thing you got a check for that is whether there's any more healthy and see her health at the top
this is always with a sketchy one because basically most of the floor turns into death in a minute
you watch this little green Rings everywhere
or not we're going to kill too quickly
so we killed a quickly because every hit was doing
hangover damage
quite rapidly wouldn't fight it's a time
back-to-back I get 85 Darkness
which means you go to get something like 32 health
Maxis out again
and we've escape to the first layer of Hell
well which would give you some help
whatever goes red that's he's talking to you
cafe
here is your box of trinkets and
and you got a whole load of these you get by talking to different characters and giving them stuff
each one give you a slightly different
bonus so like the colour for example give me 50 bonus Max health
displacer
less damage for the front but more from the back
10% damage tracking and damage photos
keeping
feather duster
give you 6% chance to give you a health regen item whenever you break apart
which is why we get so many pots with health in them
that's why we're keeping that one
spiky collar came from the three-headed dog cerberus
in a bit
is another mini shop
and then you got this little thing next to it
play some lazy to remove anyone that you want
sell it for some money
no the feather duster came from dusa
ok Medusa
because her job is basically keep the House of Hades clean
so she doing a lot tidying up and cleaning and therefore she has a feather duster
so no escape the first level of Hell
we have
finish Tartarus when on acid
again we don't need to really check the pots at this point but will do it anyway just out of habit
there's another health burrito that came out and bought we got myself but it's stupid to leave it there
come back later so I'll take it anyway
eggy hot how you doing how was lunch
and we're going to go straight in
another pump fight
how do you speak Dungeon turn off

yeah you need to have a load of KSP about that
however
I don't want to know where I can sing
I got a promise I will get it upgrades and Mortimer Boons
I think
more bonus damage reduction
always a wise policy reduce damage as much as possible
that's something we might find it obviously got to be careful here because that llama hurts don't step in the lava
this is a thing it's a recurring theme in August
and options we got here it upon which upgrades one moon or more importantly we got the Daedalus our other Daedalus hammer give you a weapon upgrade
you want a weapon upgrade weapon upgrades are excellent things to have
you gotta fight for the day love summer
again I didn't really need that health immediately
are United on
trying to keep as much of this away from me as possible because those
purple balls hurt
and that bomb thing on the ground
also hurts if you're stood in the circle when it fires
it will take the hammer out how do I give you a choice of weapon upgrades
so I can either use
especially get study between a bit faster
I can have my special becoming a charge shot which I'm not using special I might anyway
I can have the one I've not had yet the joining Castle which whenever I kill someone with a special
store 2% house will have that anyway because
we won't be
we won't be prophecy
we doing ok on this one so far I'm just checking the parts not I need to really but in case I got money in them
again we have the choice of a boon or shop
which one to take it always the shop
tell me to explain what

we have three options two of them a normal Boons and 1 of an aide Boon
8 buns are very special thing they unlock was called the goat Gage
you'll see your now got another gauge in the bottom left when I'm not talking follow my help page
four bars in it
and what that does he is as I kill things
fills up and when I was section of the goes yellow
invoke power of a god
model for sections going yellow I can get a superpower from God
and they basically give you a free bonus
which are well worth having
so we want them so if you haven't got an aid already and you get offered an age moon you take the aid

made perfect sense to Wharf
it made perfect sense
so we just killed in minibus
can I say geeky heart a few times
what happens if I say geeky heart
my heart is something supposed to happen
have you told it something so that randomly it respond to the word keycards
are you trying to get it to learn how I say geeky hot so you can go something later
because if that's what you're trying to do then I think he is going to get a bit confused by mentioning her name so many times
I think we're going there was some confusion there
and it clearly doesn't like geeky hartal that much
yeah you were training it
you can blame ksb for that
blame KSP
however
things are happening apparently what have we got here
we have some booms we have a choice of special dealing more damage anything week cost of being a wind short-range blasting fixed week
when close to Slane

I knew that was going to happen at some point
becoming I think it's already been programmed to be self-aware
so yeah hit the right trigger button it via the Aphrodite's 8
I wish gets me
assistance
and of course I don't want to stand in the lava too long with the sun in the lava gets you hurt

I believe there's a strict set of safety protocols
we haven't talked to had a ban anybody yet for alarm call yet
we might at some point
feel so have a poem we have a health upgrades will have money in this case of these three options the max health upgrade is the most important one

that's not how this works
Sophie fire god gauge and that's where that heart thing comes from
take the burrito
there are still some enemies probably up here somewhere
yellow bar is there armour so is there an armoured anime like a yellow bar as well
and if I get a body to destroy that before we can get to the Red Bar
which is going relatively ok at the moment
you'll notice I'm looking for all the parts
there is a shop you can't use that was during combat you have to finish combat before the shop becomes available
at least things are annoying because they spit little balls that turn into stone
and even I can most leaderflex application you can't
you take the max light off in most of the time that also replenishes your existing life as well
you got the shop here
you could buy more health again
we're not going to edit xx Kiki heart very well does it
I'm impressed
so we get a boon from Hermes
get Maxell football we get a shop
I've already discussed this the option here is that you take the shop
the shop does not involve a fight
unless you are lucky you get a car on boss fight which occasionally happens
doesn't like me destroying all of these parts but I want the house that's in them
you said you hate him
and we've only got 155 money
have you got a tough choice Siri can I have more Max Health app which immediately also gives us that much extra normal house or we can have a boon I think we're going to take the help
because taking the house gives us
bonus self-important
are we going into a boss fight where we can get some Darkness because we beat the boss before
this is the lernayin bone hydra
which needs to die but has lots of heads at all come from Turkey
Chinese of June if you don't always get the house yes indeed
so this is a Lennon bone hydra
is a very unpleasant chap
and he will try and smack you on the head he will spit purple things that you and he will spawn his other heads
so when he gets shielded he's on the heads are coming out and they need to be killed first
that's one down
each head has a slightly different set of weapons of things
unitas on dashing here in there
and that's the try and keep me from being completely wiped out
so he will now lose his shield again
I'm not using the God power yet
is your notice at the bottom left it is filling up and if you get all four segments filled up you get the super god power
rather than the bass got power
so this encounter he comes up more heads again
and I want to hit as many of these as I can
I want to unlock the super God now which I've got
but I don't want to use it on any heads and there's a reason I don't want use it on the heads
and that's because this super god power is
basically I massively heavy hits
so what I want to do is keep the dog cage for
the money has as quick as possible
which I have to do a hit in the head not the body
and then when lonely comes back to this like this
now you'll find your god gauge
Aphrodite's maximum the head kills him
and that's how we win that battle
Aphrodite Google
and then you take your Darkness which basically give you full health back because you got 170 of its and therefore you got a decent amount of health with the darkness
now United the three little circles above my health bar down the bottom left those on my desk device
when
they are basically respawn lines where I am
so if they get emptied then I get no response
so we have finished
we will get the fountain which we don't need but we've got to take it you can't not take it otherwise it was unlocked the rest of this
I got a shop at again we're going to get 30 money so we're not buying in the shop
I'm going to proceed on through
so when I'm coming up to where we were earlier Elysium
again we're going to break all the parts because why not
is a slightly different in here
ain't golden there different colour
we get a choice of upgrading an existing boon taking another Boon
due to give you bones for Speed
we're already on a bit of speed run for the most been the better let's take Hermes Boon
so
good night through here we're going to hit these things
enemies you'll notice when they die
the little bum
we things spawn
these things are basically the soul of the enemy
stay around too long then the enemy respawns
are all enemies have basically an autoresponder
if you don't kill their soul
the butterflies collect the souls as well and there's a butterfly boss later that spawns a whole bunch of Souls
you do not want to be dealing with that
I got some money from killing that butterfly
as unusual
take the Boom
see what happens got 2 offers
so they go you know Hermes is I got to speak because you talk to really fast
the nobody else
so we have when you have when you hit you have a chance to talk to dodge automatically
the taking damage dash to recover
auto god gauge game
auto god gauge Gain is an excellent Hermes didn't skip leg day no he didn't cough no he didn't
ancient Greek unit of light yes indeed
I think the chance to Dutch basically means 10% chance to not be hit by an enemy Will Take That
would definitely just finished your final weapon ranjani does that mean you completed it with also weapons now
this is to take the central hot in the next area
Topps Tiles never a bad option
these little chariot things are annoying
are basically fireworks on Wheels
and a charge towards you and explode in your face
remember kids don't play with fireworks
kill the butterfly thing quickly so does the spawn lots of butterflies
will sauna stay outside the blast radius of those eggs
now you can dash through obstacles as well
let's take that help up
shop
but we're not going to take any of these options
as we need to save our money for the big shop we haven't got a lot of money
so will destroy all the parts
the range of the Exploding egg
just check there's no other parts around
stone would normally have the Eternal Trove on it if it's spawned
it hasn't done so it's not there
going to spawn it was born there
racing you can bring the house down always wise
and as usual we got the choice of The Palm to upgrade one of your things
the shop
YouTube the last three today I'm very nice normal my second
I'm on my way
first run starting today but second run of the day cos we started part way through
I will look at the darkness because we need to take the doctor's anyways health
and is there anything I can afford
so we take that
and we have a choice of Aphrodite or Poseidon
no he's the most difficult once because you can't have decide whether you want to do you build based on lots of lots of Gods or one or two gods
are we got a lot of Dionysus here
we've got some inside already
this a diagnosis Athena duo
that looks like
we took that moment ago so we got four different gods on our side
I'm going to say that we want to take
probably Poseidon
have much for him today
going to take the sidemen
there are as with everything skill trees and Tactics and what you should take him when an
you can tell I don't pay much attention to those things
you know you can follow all the prescribed rules and everything
or you can just run through and enjoy the game
as you can see I tend to take the latter approach with
enjoy the game
so we can kill these things as quick as we can
no all the guard things with the spheres
they will stab you quite happily they don't care whether your friend or foe
take every opportunity to disturb you
we are punching things yes indeed jammy
we are punching things lots
so we got the option of
what is more damaging not supposed away random treasure
oh god gauge charges faster when you take damage
I take quite a bit of damage and having more god Gates speed is always good
treasure is also good though
treehouse bar restaurant
the one health bar
what do you mean by three help boss
this is a tough choice the good gauge is good but so is the
older layering so yeah you got your other than you got your health
you got something else there as well
I prefer having
having 3 separate bars next to me
Highland cow down you got a bit peckish then you eat three snack bars
what do we do see the treasures good but shows the God gauge
I think we take the dog gate to this time
does that mean we can call in the gods quicker
ok we're going to take on a minibus regardless we had a Dionysus heavy run
we have got an Athena boon let's take another Asena
this is my boss we dislike this is the butterfly minibus
and it has all these Souls in these Souls if we don't take them out
start spawning back into units that we killed previously
so we need to come and manage them
like that
that happens when they start hitting you
so we got a 1 of Bernice to the death as quick as possible but also manage all the ads
yes I don't know what the grey bit is on there
ok yes this is now ad management
the quicker we kill these Souls the less likely they are to respawn
we do not want to respawning
so do that
I do like this music this game has an excellent soundtrack
do the great deal with this
ok so
we want to take this one
for the
fated choice
doing well with this thank you very much
the fated choice because that is the only one that we haven't had before
when you deflect attack to deals more damage
that is useful because
that way when I just reflect
it hurts the more than what they would hurt us
I do like the holy shield it is a better Boon
I want to take the stated choice and I think it actually could be good for this run
I never get a prophecy fulfilled so that means we got stuff back at the House of Hades for later
to go and pick up which is always nice
talking of picking things up from we need to pick up some rewards instru Motors which you got up about 30 seconds so we'll check that out
epic Segways in now and again halfway if we don't drop them in there we never going to get there

well there we go so what a DJ was going to tell the time travelling joke but you guys didn't like it
God loves Avenue
always a good thing a few seconds with
a terrible joke from the robot
so what have we got we have a battle
we have 30 alloys on the field we have a heck of a lot of enemies
we're going to chuck a curse right down here we can as many of them as we possibly can
can you refund a gift something though
so we're going to check that curse down
and with 30 arrows on the field
81 enemies to kill
3 to 1 ratio will you do some serious Killers
I know you guys have got this but we need to do some serious Killers
and we are doing some serious killing and look at this mayhem going on the battlefield
this is absolute Madness
is a lot of killing going on of the enemies
we still have 20 alloys this is seriously decent
and they now have 20 enemies this is going incredibly well as we got murdered very very sad indeed rest in peace KSP stroke
because mysterious killing going on there this is good
16 of the 30 hours survive that's less than half of them died
and I complete the questionnaire when you complete question you need to go and hand it in otherwise you don't get the reward from it
play situation with forgotten most Kills at 29
the top spot but pick Raiders stole the most assist with 5
didn't get all three and doesn't get guaranteed reward so that we was going out a random random chose lifelog anyway to get that Barbarians grow but it did go out at random
course getting 6 gold and I get 15
it is a random chance to off but if you are in chat and participating you are waited heavier than the people who aren't
well you got above average girl so
toilet exit
I said we had a quest to hand in so he's gonna do that let's collect those strolls what are they Barbarians cross excellent
it will help but we're going to kick off this next battle which is around and back on the really taking the top Road it cos we got our eyes on the prize here at this loyalty skin chest
the skin chests give you skins that you'd normally pay real money for
are you shouldn't die dwarf you should definitely open up through Moses
so worth we got our quest still involve any event tokens killing epic enemies getting units to level 20 and getting a cyst so
leveling up enemies
with another warrior it's going up here
get those units in we will see that in just about half an hour
underground a quick drink
don't get keep yourself hydrated as well thanks
and we're going to get straight back into 80s
hopefully
choice between money and health
health is always our option
it's that old question that they used to ask
what do you want your money or your life
all my life
not to be confused with somebody asking do you want your money or your wife
that's very different question
why is Magic hydrate because I set it up
thought I'd be difficult
confuse people you can change it if you want
stream deck
I think I probably set it up with people complaining they didn't have a channel points redeem for it
I thought I'd make it a unique command instead
something slightly different does everybody have a hydrate redeem
how to get confirmation code that's new daddy's indeed new that sounds like to eat off rather than stream Raiders itself
we want to stay out of there when
yeah that sounds like to each other off rather than stream doing anything
Google say all through this is something else you need to be aware of
over here we have Hermes give you one Boon
here however you can see the mini boss icon and there's two Boons there
that's what they call the trial of the Gods
just a second because you always take because if you get off it
Wigan right in now what this means is you coming to here
and find the house because you need it
trust me you're going to need it
so trial of the Gods
you get to bonus
you get a choice of Boon
and you choose one and we get one you don't choose you then have
as well as fighting
the normal enemies that would appear in this room
when you beat that God you get that God spoon as well
we are take the side because apparently he's very very difficult to fight because he's been is a nightmare or is abilities a nightmare
so we take his boom first
and I think we're going to take
we're getting a cast
so
aphrodites can be grumpy
apparently she is
Aaliyah Hadid
that makes sense
he's not grumpy with us and therefore is going to help these things try and kill me
hence hearts bouncing around
when is trying to avoid getting hit by then
and by the traps and by the enemies
that recovery was one of the Souls coming back
I'm gonna use Aphrodite gets Aphrodite
I'm going to try and avoid the Aphrodite hits
trying to avoid getting hit by him in the Trap as well
use Aphrodite on this one
I mean she's gonna be told to be grumpy because he picked the sidemen over her
we're going to hit all of these as quick as we can
avoid getting hit by her smell which is not very easy
service users of a big health it always will because they're god fightstar
very hectic
but it's well worth it for the double boom reward
GG hot air flying around as well
so we get a second moon now
always nice
put something to bed apparently
and reasonable
what's she going to give us
more damaging effects week after you take damaged damaged phones around Union week or bonus life game
that's only for Max health up
is handy but I think revenge damage
we better
yes indeed
yes indeed key and I thought you might say that dwarf
this is one of the top is because we can never have Max health increase
we can have a better mutation that a weapon mutations are almost always excellent
Max help is always a solid chat
nutation
and the reason going to take that is because this is kind of the most powerful moon in the game
now what you see here is the summer so just turned off turned up
why the room went cream when sanitize turns up you and he fights side-by-side and it's a competition to see who can kill more of the enemy's first
so if you kill more than other skills he give you an extra reward if you don't then he doesn't give you the actual reward by the way he sits there and help to fight the enemies
so I'm gonna get myself
a quick health pickup
and then I'm going to get straight on with the killing
I can beat Thanos to The Killing
so at the top let you get the counters
there is 73 at the moment
it could go either way
he has some seriously solid attacks
he basically will something to die in indices immediately
which is why we are killing as quickly as we can and killing as many as we can
because he generally gives you a health up reward or something like that
can give you a boon
stop
equals extra health
so we gonna call in
a couple of Aphrodite Boons
I've got bills
keep flying around here try and take this one out
but he's also giving us 25 Max else
will take the max health
will talk to him
hey Rick how you doing
good to see you buddy
what does sanitizer have ribs in his armpit that's a very good question
how's it going week how did the Stringer did you enjoy the rest of it did you beat your records
so we take the Hammer
all very nice attack becomes a 3 hit sequence rather than 5 hit but deals 40 base damage per hit
yes
give me a significant damage boost
so we've got a choice of things we can potentially buy
main time with the turtles very nice
we're not gonna take that yet because it would take this troll first
and get yourself some extra gems
and also means we can test out this weapon tweak
see if it's going to hit even harder
so far it seems to be getting harder
as it's not quite so rapid
but he did the job
that is solidly rapid
let's have a quick look at this shop
what have we got we got 300 gold
we can spend 29 gold and get another 73 health
that is a valid thing to spend 29 gold on
will take that the other two are not so worried about that one
worth having an option out of a shop or apart
obviously we take the shop
because the shop does not involve a fight
we take that extra 10
showing the n
I have 271
we can't quite afford all three rewards
definitely want me spoon though
what's the office
hello
what's Poseidon doing here
ok yes so we get a duo Boon
Boons you'll find a more potent
I think that's a wise thing to take
that's a solid you a boon
definitely take that
now got a choice of upgrading a boon
or taking
the darkness which gives us some health
and obviously because going to boss fight we take the darkness gives us
some health
because we know this is not a boss fight
we can see that because your skull with the river next to it with the star on top
so
Jimmy is welcome in Jimmy
KSP can we set out to tell people they're idiots if they try welcome themselves
can you put one of those you need to find a second person to welcome thing in there
and there's no Pokémon we're coming
Pokémon

no I'm delivery not fire in the God ability yet
but each time I hit them I damaging both of them
and I want to get the full god ability rather than just the half god ability
there we go
snow on fire
some serious damage later
now will fire a little one
we still got through this device we're going to leave them I imagine
oh he's calling debitor in that's not very fair
he's not supposed to be recalling gods
this is getting beyond reasonable here
OK Google kill the bull
just got to take out Theseus
if we if we careful
we can do this without losing another
there we go we did it just on the last hours without losing another bestify
to help being there
country felt back
let me get some more back
it's looking about right they're doff it's looking about right
that was a tricky boss they always are
well then we get the
get the extra help again from the well
which take us to full health
so you can spend 200 Gold here to get warmed fi back
I don't have 200 Gold to spend
oh hello you completely broken it there what happened there Jimmy was that you put quotes in and it didn't like you couldn't quotes in
without the quotes and see if it works
it doesn't like it when you stick quotes in A String
try again without the quotes and you should be ok
no I didn't Kodak command
well done Jimmy for Breaking the Year boat
so we've now completed to the Elysium area
when I'll going into the temple
yeah would have I'll grab it from the webpage
sexiest man expected over actually
who was the manager of the webpage anyway if you log into nightbot.tv and grab your uid from your profile section I'll have it so you can actually like the web page in mods things as well
ok so we're gonna start by taking the gold the gold is a good thing to take
so each of these Chambers involves fighting rats and the rats poison you
when I do you need to go to the fountain
that little green Tree saying
I need to cleanse your poison
is poison is not good that takes a health
we need the money so we can go all the way through here
there was some more baby rats
baby rats don't seem to be doing the boys in the adult rats do
ASDA burrito like a burrito
so we're running through his chamber and laser quite rapid fire chamber runs
only sale with this weapon anyway

that was quick
oh dear
like to get upset at some point
this is one of the big ones that drops poison flags
I so need to try and kill it before it does
no sorry Jamie that's not a command
that's not something it understands
avoid this green slime as best we can
you can use the things
Midway through
Syria poison again there now
so we going clear the poison
I kill that thing
I'm good and there's more
I've no idea what these things are they look nasty so they get killed first
I think with the rats is that the poison can basically cause Mayhem
so you can't want to keep that as contained as possible which is not always easy
and then just back and grab yourself some health
or some region
and then take the gold because
kill everything
hopefully you're not going to die
now there's nothing in here we can give us more health
so head back
oh dear Wicker Man to get voice commands on his stream you know you're gonna have to teach you to speak Northern now as well as the right
you gonna have to teach you this week and all them
oh hello take one Daedalus hammer off and give two more Daedalus hammer options instead
ok
so I gained two abilities
didn't get a choice
yeah you are going to have to teach you this week's northern and that's going to be no mean feat
well you said it not me
so we can go for the healthiest on
money and health always good things to start with
ACU thing is DK if he was German he be very efficient
and I don't think efficiency is something you can accuse some
Wicca of displaying
ok I am going to take that
because that gives me
dance
dropping health for the next 3 and Countess
so it definitely take that
does I like health help is good and we're going to need as much as we can get here
avoid the tsunami blades of death
the obvious reason
and the word loads of death as well they look very nasty
basically anything that looks like death we want to avoid there's a burrito drop mine anyway
come for second discussion in toasties chap dialects
something dialect something something
toasties something something
I do wish these rats would leave less poison on the ground
I'll come along that's not on
ok
let me go so we get the status at which is what we need to progress
baguette on Max life
we get our healing fat mountain which replenish is most of our life
get a burrito and give us even more
my head back
is a fishing spot
do the fishing
diesel glowy things he's fishing places
oh wait for it to the flashing
Bosch rolling just a normal vanish
pick up Scafell which we can exchange with the house chef later
Syria gems are valuable but right now nowhere near enough money
get a couple more Aphrodite Bowness ordering get one of them
will take one
see I'd love to take that hurt it but it replaces my divine dash and divine dashes fantastic
we're not going to have anymore Chambers to get life awards
so will take heart rate flourish
now we could go back in here again there's really no point
we're gonna lose more health and going to gain by doing so
exactly how you doing
redrum sounds fun

how many fitness that's a half double check
he looks like a pig that's not very polite
you look grumpy
we have to fight with a bizarre Dad
Royal Rumble women
he's going to run out of Cape soon
you start this Healy Burns escape
he does his finishing thing which is thoroughly annoying
you can see where it's coming from because the footsteps give it away
I've got a good feeling about this fight if I'm honest
Aphrodite helping a site there
we've only got to testify is not 3 but 2 is better than none
we're going to save up for the big dog cage
where we can we save up for the 404
ok so
female sponsor maths
which are good because they also give you god gauge
the bar because they hit you as well
and then Aphrodite can Club avs4you
I'm going to kill the souls as well otherwise they come back
that's him as well
yeah that shockwave you can't dodge basically and it's as far as I know you can't dodge anyway
so let's just knock somebody spoke as best we can
we're doing ok but Hades gets a response as well
so he also gets a testify
so we can
do this it won't kill him
but he's gonna come back
with full health again
like I said I don't think you can dodge without shockwave at all these you can dodge by hiding behind the rock
and then it's just a case of burning down yourself
I don't know what the dream pots do
OK they call Souls up
ok we've now got no debts devise left
the green parts were there last time
yeah it's not going well
this is going incredibly badly
music lorry things on my cast
yeah we going to die
we have not got the house to do is fine
the music in this fight is indeed fantastic
ok well I tried it would work
ok well we just ended that right on time for some stream Raiders
it's all about the timing with this
is everything and that's had
that makes sense
ok so we have 47 and these numbers are looking good
we're going to give the highest to these guys up here so they can rush back from this lot into the main battle
$47 let's rock and roll
60 animals to kill
1 and a half each
132 should be ok
LEGO Jimmy you can try and say hi to yourself now
is doing ok chaka leaves at the top so far or prognosis in the number one spot overall that good all change
is a lot of killing left to do dwarf taking all the top spot
is the wolf going to hold it and Dwarf has all 3 top spots right now
5-minute cool down well ok yeah that'll do it is walking to keep all three of these top spots
dwarf is holding everything is not having anybody get close
is this going to stay this way
it's a foregone conclusion at this point
is this other one conclusion it certainly looks that way
it is both sitting up there with 19 kills 7 assists the overall top spot
parenting a choice of reward
my friend would you like three centurion Scrolls or would you like 50 gold let us know in chat which one you want the other one goes at a random but you've earned yourself a reward complain about 3-months so that's ok which one would you like you would like the Scrolls the Scrolls Mr dwarfs
is ksbc congratulations everyday get 7 I get a balance growl and good-looking nose chests
is the one you want no guys this is the loyalty skin chest
pick up these things from the reward track
always useful to do that and then we can get this back kicked off
everything in for the skin chest
Lotus king chess records by chance to win skins that cost of real money to buy normally
I still need to get you to level 20 my centurion is the obvious choice for this look at all of you as that wk20 centurion
is popping straight there
if we can't take out a bunch of these units
so you got half an hour we will see this in a bit
they know it's time to do another run
which one to prove that that first kill wasn't a fluke

there we go
what do you mean mumbling I wasn't mumbling
it was mumbling the news on this and you went under the word on it
I certainly wasn't mumbling
oh good so we got infernal Trove upgrade
exactly you cannot exactly
ok
so we can pay for some things
the work orders which are the things that we want most are all now Jim
payments
what we've got for the rest of the stuff is
b&ce
Little Gem from the big diamonds
can be used for some of these upgrading the
room stuff
so let's take some deep cleaning
get rid of services hair
it's a little bit better
a cheeky get Wick
silence talk to office again
so what that upgrade did there
have your prayers we got their food bank one of them
yes so these upgrades the work orders that you see here
they give you better things so you had to do a work order to unlock the infernal truth
and another one to get the keepsake boxes
and the healing Chambers things like that and the most recent we just picked up
Davis
The Superior plunder so even more Rewards In The infernal trucks
the lounge work order that we just picked up
play the way all of celebrities fur
and you have to do enough Renovations to unlock the court music stuff
and that I think takes you down the office story
so we don't want to do that
is the Orpheus storylines good now I need to go and see the chef
and hand in that fish
my fighter fish gives us 40 chance
so we can spend those 40 gems immediately at the contractor
we can know what's the time in the lounge we can repair the damage caused by cerberus
if you watch a ripped up all the walls
and the walls on the floor and I'm no longer a ripped up
and we knew we need to do those because they have the stars on them
The Wanted the stars alone 21st I think
so we need to do more of those to unlock tomorrow storyline
auntie runs that far off this
come on 50 on now
I'm sorry there's quite a lot to do
each of these runs and attempt to kill Heidi's another of the rump is talking talking about
it is an excellent game and absolutely excellent game
the character design is fantastic storyline fantastic
voice acting is great
the music and the soundtrack
is fantastic everything about this game is excellent so as I can tell
so you saw we were picking up those fated prophecies
this scroll is the property scroll
because we picked up those prophecies in completed them we can get 150 gems out this one
150 there when we finish it
and there and their and they're each these can give you a whole bunch of them so we only been one more from Hermes to unlock 150 from him as well
essentially there's a whole bunch of these rewards you can get things like these so 10153 bloods the bloods are used for changing your weapon stats or specs
again the diamond we use
other upgrades and things
there's a whole bunch of things
we need to do
M25 fish at least one very rare and reporter beside me ok
so there are useful things to do
we can afford two more maybe three more upgrades
got Legacy
no we don't get any food one because I'm actually out
we need 2000 Darkness
so we're getting upgraded with w b
is it going to give us this time
it's gonna give us another shield run
then we could see you later grab whichever way from you want you know I wanted to do a sword run I could
I could take a soldier on easily but
I want that bonus Darkness I'm gonna start this is but his health and 20% is a lot
unfortunately because I'm using
shield now
I have to turn some heater on the heat gauge again because we've done a shielder on this got out once
so we have to
head here we have to add something back onto the heat gauge
massive Atwood just mean the each photex 1Xtra hit
one-hit I can deal with I think
hey now come down people come back
I think everybody likes do so in this game
I was Aphrodite cannot resist time
or is she going to offer us
attack deals damage in freaks week yes please
and immediately the right choice to take
yes you see that a blue one hit
line on it sealed there
hello chaos before we've even started
so this thing in the floor here is chaos
you hit that you take health damage you see the bottom it says - 21 l
you take that but you get a boom guaranteed
did I miss the fish and Anchor made Mr Fish
I've just seen Seamus message come up
haven't got Mr Fish the chaos is always good because chaos give you a boon Casey's Bloons however always have a kicker
I know just a simple one like everything else
examine more dots
do they do anything other than tell you thinks do they actually progress things
the chaos
has these
call little lord it's ok
so like excruciating strike for example that's available to take early on when things aren't going to hurt you that badly
attack dealing 33% bonus damages important
take them all and kill the shopkeep you can't
so we'll look at the door
that's a very good question to off
I don't know
oh yeah and I'll give you the right to court regulate we're gonna take the darkness a bit of Darkness health
and we know my policy on health you can never have enough of it
sonevable the little blue bar which basically means I take one extra hit before they die
I want it before they start taking damage
that's ok because that's just one hit you know it's not the end of the world
take the health or take the burrito
destroy all the parts because pots aren't allowed
I'm going to take this
is ambrosia or a supposed to be
yes I do I have juices Shawn to give you better health drops
so the chance of using gives me a better chance of getting health drops in pots
so good amateur boon coming up this time
so at the moment I'm still taking extra damage
brother to encounters
which is why I need to get them killed as quick as possible and wine doing this at the low level
if we were high level up this run
I would not be taking that Boon
is the moon where I take bonus damage
is a terrible thing to have a high level when the enemies hit you lots more have more health
or this level
can't hit me they can't do bonus damage
and I've basically what you seeing here they don't get chance to hit me
pumpkin spice latte sounds good to me
where's mine
what's the temperature going to office
can have two different things which boost
ok yeah we taking frozen touch
is that boosts
things and
property auction
we're going to take all these anyway even though we don't technically need the health
is there a Max
she got Darkness or we got a key
Darkness is what we need here
also DJ do you like pumpkin spice latte
command (also dj do you like pumpkin spice latte), ele0 (Not today), ele1 (can,you)

they're not sure
when you can buy me one drink it yeah that'll be ok
I'm good so you heard that noise there that noise was the chaos moon the stopping being me taking extra damage and starting being
33% bonus damage dealt
which is a much more valuable thing to do
I could take a minibus to get a boon or
take a shop and not get hit
interesting round here
we can do a car and fight already
ok
let's take a Hermes spoon
speed
Rubicon
I quite like the idea of Bonas gold push member
but if we do this boss fight we're going to get 300 old right off the bat anyway and hold on to extra so
I think actually the move speed or
hyper sprint
hyper sprint I think because I'm doing a lot of dashing anyway
so we can borrow Karen 300 gold would you meet me means we end up in a fight with him
that he is solid as you'd like so it's going to take a lot of Keeley
is very upset by that
and he's going to try and kill us
pictures of the erebus
and we fight against him and he tried to kill with his all
you getting already staring it all up
ok those purple orbs do a lot of damage
and so does he
yeah he is a nasty one is probably going to kill me a couple of times in this fight
but it might be alright
even if it kills a couple of times there's a good chance you can still
call that later
dog age
yeah there we go he's killed his once
always seems to happen
is impervious means
you can do that which is not very pleasant open
can't very unhappy about sex
and I guess I can understand we destroyed shop every time we go there
and we stole his money as a shopkeeper is not very happy with either of those actions
as death
this usually happens I don't know whether we can get all the way to
the end or not
polarised doing well dodge and all that stuff and any hit me on the head anyway
dodging these orbs
is tricky
and didn't work very well yeah I don't think we're gonna win this
we Gotta burn yourself down quite quickly out
and he's doing a lot of hitting
yeah I think was scuppered
this is definitely not looking good
I can't leave more Bloons to do more damage and have more health
yeah
too early on
first time he's killed us
happens occasionally
if you die in hell it sends you back to Hades
you come out of the pool of blood again
do I have sisters keepsake I believe so I will need to double check
50 cookies are good

apparently altar DJ does like barrels
always always Rule number one
if you can always pet the dog
always bet the dog
the rules
best thing about the game
small fish
there's no inspection spots to pick up
Nexus disappeared
Kelly's is always pretty cool
we haven't got this but we check anyway
so yeah the drink it's we've got
so you were asking about
which trinket was it
Achilles one is there
sizzlers attacks restaurant cost deal 30% damage
50% damage was not empowered
that's handy
but I tend to power them up pretty much immediately
and
the health is more useful to me I think
I need to figure out where these last three come from
it is 1 here
and to hear that I haven't unlocked yet
Anderson secret stashes and I don't know how to unlock those either
Museum Boom for Tata stand switch
that's a valid option
you can't switch at the end of each thing
it wants us to do a gun run the gun is not my favourite weapon
Butler steak
this off the chart
and get straight into it
NAVIGON is
least useful weapon in my opinion although the speed runners all seem to like it
let's have a chat with Zeus and see what he wants to give us
no I think the Bose actually better than the gun person
what's it going off for us
special causes Lightning Bolts
causes of burst of chain lightning
dash causes Lightning Bolts
this one I think cast is going to be good for
and the chaos
if you wanna come to the grenade launcher
Estate chaos
because it's early into the run
what's chaos coronavirus
grumpy
bonus money
yes bonus money
we're going to take some gemstones
I definitely will take the gemstones because
gemstones and Coulson darkness comes next
policy and darkness Darkness is health
I dislike this weapon all Things Considered
I mean the grenades alright
we're doing this for the bonus starting this rather than because we like the gun
only been 10 otherwise
gaboon from
Artemis system
mostly using the grenade here
is what it's not
usually quick
it kind of works
what are we going to get a taxi stronger with better chance for Chris
I think we're going to have annoyed because we haven't got an idiot
seeking arrows are excellent
notice as well the traps disable themselves when you
Lisa room so you can walk over them quite freely
there's a gold pot
contain money
because money
because shop
it's darkness first
yes he was a much slower and much more sedate run
a right it's more a slow amble than a run
and still they hit us
yoghurt
Oasis evolved
so the chaos evolution is now extra 40% gold
minibus coming in
astina
we had a Zeus already let's have an Athena
is more different gods the better I think
and this is one of those where you can't
because so stands telling
if you stand still they throw grenades at you
so you have to keep dodging the grenades
which is one of Throne is grenades at them and trying to avoid getting it
and that is 3 m
what are the Megabus
hello yes divine dash always divine Dash
this is the best Ash in the game
and by far the most useful thing the things you can give us
talking of useful Dover Street Motors and I'm seeing comments about Archers on the frontlines not necessarily being alright
we're going to see what happens how many units have we got this time
we have 35 we have a number down here
if you hear we have a few up here
I think I'm going to do is II
give these guys down here the his spell
let's rock and roll let's see how we do this one
you got 62 and 35 alloys
I'm hoping as units down the bottom there do some killing and then shift away into the battle
don't worry dwarf none of us really know what we doing
show me professor poseidon's wavedash
wavedash is a good chat
I can't prefer the dash deflect
I will know star UK sitting at the top there absolutely rocking it was great scene
hope you're doing alright tonight buddy
rockin' everything smashing all of those top spots
you gonna have to hope you're in chat because you guarantee you suffer reward with that performance
the new swing by cos you're going to be needing to tell us what reward you want
or a local skin chest
568b taken on top 3 sports that's understandable
50 gold or 200 Gold
I think I can guess which one is going to take
can I get a tiny pencil Paladin
north Star dropping the channel is no way they won't 50 gold or if you want 200 Gold I think I know which one is going to 1
it's a hard choice they're very very hard choice for any Viewer to make
that's what I'm thinking that's what I'm thinking
but it's very difficult decision yeah he might only want 50
not want to 100
not being in chat
you know that is a valid call hutcherleigh
do authors make a good point
yeah it's a difficult decision
I mean
I would ask for it was me but it isn't me
he could be feeling like he wants to 50
I could be feeling like you want to 200
glasses in chat will never know
perhaps you think dwarfs playing this I think is the best
milstar next few seconds
does somebody do an ask the should he get 50 gold

I get these units down half an hour and battle kick off again
we'll see that in a bit
right now we've got some Darkness to learn
is very definitely that time
we Gotta Get that we don't like
but it will do

it was very wise indeed
excuse me
it has many more
we got a Daedalus hammer
this Daedalus hammer may well mean that we can actually make I've got a bit more useful
that was silly standing on the spikes
the Cluster Bomb
attack is faster and more accurate in games six bullets
yes
Will Take That
oh hello
now this one is more useful
well done KFC
yes we now have a data back a weapon
shop
next remission I like extreme mission
they can never be too much happiness
efficient point
we will do the fishing
Leicester Road me when you need a fish expert
Carol to talk to us
autocar upsetting a Foodbank
I could fight with him again
I don't think that's not as there's a 5-minute cooldown on my key so that's not gonna work for a while
right we're definitely taking the house
do we take hermès or do we take Artemis
we have a good day dual ready
Hermes
Kirkgate automatically charges is very very solid
soz rapid fire cast
especially if we get a better
upgrade
we're not going to fight him
be silly at this point
unrelated
yeah I mean it could well have been because you won't have just had the
stop that you potentially have had
it is an AMD chip you allowed in a juicer update if it's an Intel chip you've had a firmware update for the chip
R&A management engine update as well so potentially that could help with the whole bunch of stuff
so I can see that making a difference
yeah this guns a lot better now
it's gone is significantly better now
let's have some truth because let's have some Darkness
yeah I think that is cool down you can do is 5 seconds
yeah the guns getting better
how much Darkness 83 yes please
that Max is our health that'll do nicely
and we got a pump coming up
Theodore facut absolutely make sense
oh yeah this is working
ok and we can upgrade
to collect we can upgrade cost
we can upgrade call I think we upgraded call
yes
this gun was only
upgrade was an excellent choice
nothing to do with respect this was the
what do I call it
ok
so we can't have the health and the Boon
health up in the moon
I think we probably want the moon
is a tough choice because we're going into the boss fight so kinda want the house
we can't have both
are the money for
there's nowhere here that's got anymore money
I think it helps has to be with Joyce
and
it's a waste of money but
would do anyway what would be maxed out for the boss fight
lady murder
I'm going on a
mission of exploration
I should not very happy
yeah it is definitely working
we were close to dying the help was a correct choice
health was definitely correct choice
five health left we would not have made that without buying extra Max
is it Max at this time that's fine because we're fountain here
navigate we got the fountain
we are going to change this up now for the house
lucky tooth would give us an extra testify around might be worth taking
Mamadou is taking when we're about to go into the baby's IPN
dance interesting
and by interesting I mean it's interesting that the didn't respond to those
the first one is outside the 10-second cooldown
I've been going to why KSP you do double Dash and CD as I think it needs a single dash Roland double
single dash fixers that
try again guys see that now works within 10 seconds
good health
give me Seamus good a test
I know you still need to put exclamation high before dashly equals 10
I just need to be single data on Audible
even though it said it worked
that's just broken
could be
TUI later
there we go that looks a bit more reasonable
I'll wait 10 seconds and then try it
there we go that's what we wanted
that's good when people count to ten in that
write what I want to upgrade
yes will upgrade or Boone again
restore up to 150 health yes
yes they are
what
if you please die quicker
we're getting 27l
sounds like you're terrible decision
losing or taking a death is a terrible movie
I did not work out at all the way it should have done
although I have got character in cancer which is good
I think you're right through I think I did not go that as well as it should have done
list the character in calendar and see we get offered
it's going to be the usual stuff
yeah lots of tattoos
date
yeah so normally will pick up the refreshing next at which gives the next £3 upgraded rarity
I think we can upgrade up to two at random
very nice we did get to
flurry cast epic
I think it must have been
well it's got to be in order electric show or divine dash the got pushed off
define Dash
either way we got upgrades upgrades a good
level of pizza vitality yes something like that
Lesley enemies
that's what I love about this Dash
is he can do that and just hurt them
with their own spells
as long as you actually hit their spells
you have to hit the wave a Spell
I dislike these things are a nuisance
I bet you can die
what is a shotgun
for cheap
yeah I think will take help for cheap
even though we got a big shop coming up as well
that might be good pointlink that might be good point
ok will take the pump is it can't afford anything else
let's push
I keep pushing the God get a job
oh good
infobae
ok
it says good but in reality is not
you could maybe not that would be appreciated
yeah I know I do not like this
all the things being spat around everywhere are bad
what have we got then
baboon is good
another thing was aquatic exercises certainly wasn't synchronised swimming
hello model we got
bonus reward yes please
but attack doing more damage and knocking foes away
that's handy
Will Take That
I love the rewards but I think they're not back is gonna be better
oh yeah that's
that's interesting
this is starting to be a good combo now
it's still not ideal but
it's getting better
we didn't beat in this time but we did once
attack is faster
yes
also yes
ever since I empty magazine in seconds
Amy nursery easy
magazine emptying 11 out of 10
let's take some health
I should check there's no more Health over here cos if there is we want it
do that in tarkov
upgrade my Mac to shoot that fast
I'm told ammunition is very very weird thing in tarkov
and told that you're supposed to conserve ammunition not find many many shells at once
what have we got we got a shop we take the shop
butter slipped
good burrito
I thought was checking forward checking for burritos
I can only afford the gym so we're gonna take the gems
and we're going into a boss fight we're going to lose at least one test if I hear
this is a foregone conclusion
learney hurts a lot
learning course being a learner in bonara
who we are now reached
that is how you empty a Mac very quick
see Neil is going to be best if I ever
I was just getting to cost so weak
there's a lot of things to think about in this
I can not being
in the lava
no that was useless and I can't get to those casts
that is a problem
very nice
sounds good as Rock
yeah there's another desk
I don't normally have problems with this boss
then normally I have a very different attitude and approach
a lot more mobile than I am here
yes he that doesn't work so well
yeah good for the baths but not so good when
you trying to deal with a slightly different approach to it
and that was not a good approach
50 x cheeky devil
always always pet the dog
that's not what I wanted to do
switch the wrong button
nectar but he can have it anyway
pet the dog
press the correct button it does the correct action
always put the door kids rules
we know this
oh dear
Kitty is sad
can I see that the CME what's a CME
what are you referring to with CMA in this particular instance
oh yeah well that's always gonna happen
when you get one of those that always cause problems
the band will be dead basically
ladies a feature we haven't got
not good column hedge
early Janet Leigh
we got a spear on this time
it also got stream Motors
stream Raiders 80s what have we got on the battlefield we have 39 allies
think what we need here
he's I think we need some melee booster roundabout here on as many these we can get
and
yes 13 hours on the field let's rock and roll
46mm is not too many
one of your customers they make cigarette packing machines understandable
what have we got we got a few units left to kill
is going well
I should not be at the top of the kills list I am no longer at the top of the kills list this is good this has been rectified
no maybe not
as much more sensible
yeah
it was touch and go there for awhile
KFC takeaway skills
take the most assist and ksuite a careful topsport so there's rules at random
be picking up a centurion dwarf pick up to healers I throwing up 50 gold everyone's getting seven and I get a Musketeer
so
we've definitely got time for another one maybe two if we can get to in which I think we might we can get this boss fight tonight
so let's keep this one off Let's get it going that's not back about
and I'm get a warrior down
it's not worry about but I'm going to worry here anyway
we're going to do that because I need as warrior Scrolls
so we'll see that in half an hour
I'm going to go to the run
I do like the dash strike on this one
list is carnival right be vulnerable for so long that
doesn't really work too well
let's do that technique again let's see if it helps
now then we don't need anything on the heat gauge
because we've not completed just here on yet
you said differently in Channel on settings got you I'm not sure which channel mode settings
you have to DM me what you said
fancy w
show me a DM on discord and I'll take a look at it later
yeah that's about right that is about right
ok
dash damage
special damage
oh yeah well that will just trigger anything I guess
yeah that will trigger it
see I don't want to ruin cast
it works but
and I don't want to risk the chance like 8-2 flight later and can't use it
Orlando could I still be together if left on top
this the top Choice
will take the special I think actually
I heard something about paying
ping
artificial spot get pink
we can do some fishing
inefficient volume start anything
we're going to help fish
what does a health fish
something fishy about this
catch more
crustaceans
it is

she could be nice to the bot always get upset with you
and then it'll ignore
there is always a fishy joke somewhere
reduced life but then bonus attack
no gold but then better Burns
no damage with them better goals
I think better balloons is the one to take
adding baboons is definitely want to take
especially when I don't have the
health pickup option not normally have
so would definitely take that health region
making of Max else up or we can have a green Max health up
Anglia sports getting that hosting thank you so much
are you doing tonight
how you doing
take the max light on
lesbian bed that sounds good
yes will text him Darkness
bank uksv
Darkness has been collected
yes indeed I frog
did I hear my chaos burn it off
decided
so that's no longer giving me a disadvantage
I can earn gold again
good job because I'm coming to the chamber weather reward his gold
disadvantages of I couldn't earn the reward
excellent 100 gold happy days
right where we got a shop
we like a good job
everybody likes a good shop
he is not a happy chappy never is we can have one boon and the health
let's take the house
choice
Athena or Hermes
who we got so far we have
whoever that is
Leicester Hermes
what's he going to offer us
Jane Wells
chance to water dodge
20% chance to auto dodge yes please
five hits no longer hits
definitely
let's have a chat
give him
Nexus
because reasons
do you want to say to us
the vanishing
we're ok on health aren't we
so we take the gold
and then we take the Boom from the bus and I missed a little yellow thing
hi yes it's annoying boss
I quite like a boom with a good gauge on it at some point
also quite like this thing to stay still long enough to
now we go
Artemis is not impressed
yes I like deadly strike deadly strikers good
then dash cycling damages even better
because I do a lot dash trike
see you normally just go for the crypt but
that's try cutting cos that's the one we use the most with the spear
gastric is always take
the darkness or gems
doctors
and we don't have to fight anymore for the darkness
ridiculously hot where geeky lifts
as in ridiculously hot in your house or in your time
hello that's glowing why is a glowing
why is that glowing like that I've never seen that before
I write some glowing mostly because of some rates but there's definitely a glow off that
The Rumour in
will take the germs this time because we are at full health
navigate
was only worth 10 gems 10
what's the truth going to give us
another 75 yes I'll take another 75 or 10 was a bit ridiculous
no I'm not an idiot
65 yes please
the town 3333
that is unreasonable
is entirely unreasonable
health or shop definitely the shop
there's a lot choices in this game
hello fish
what fish are we going to get this time
hellfish
what difficulty are playing on whatever than normal difficulty
ok so I haven't got god mode on
yes I'm not running with God mode on I'm playing in normal mode
I think we're going to want to take the max elf
as we go into a fight
no not Alexa
we're not running in hell mode I know that much
I will take that money
you watching losi going to try for the first time if it's your first run the stick it in God mode
John mode makes eat offer
and you won't see things like the
acts to begin with anyway
until you beating for the first time
so that will be easier anyway
but yeah if it's your first time I would say play it with God mode on
just to get yourself a custom so if nothing else
a space monkey how you doing
I don't know doesn't cheating in this game got loads of value the brooch
play London is much as I could have done with but there's a phantom here anyway
so let's have the health do that
the fountain what's the shop got
Banco truth
something like that
we could have an extra 36 hours
but I don't think it's worth because I think will pick it up in the next couple of Chambers
so I won't spend the money on that I'll keep the money for later
Wigan need every pay week yet
I could also do with the ability to come
understand house back from our charm
examined I missed it
your message came through already changed Chambers
your Law
we'll get there
I'm more worried about my Burrito to begin with
ok
you guys need to go down fast because they are irritating
I will get better the final or darts
what are we going to have bonus Dash
quick reload on quick reload think
I do like the bonus cash but I think we'll Torino tour
help more
the cost is I forget to use it because it takes so long to recharge that it doesn't become
an automatic singing My Head
a shiny docs that which can get upset with me for missing
I don't see any
I see fire I don't see tiny dots
health definitely house
I'm engaged in general that's a very difficult thing to answer
I don't have a preference depends on the game
sofa this game for example I actually started playing keyboard and mouse
until I was told I should absolutely playlist to control it because you need more than just
S&D Direction wise
to go in all directions only
joystick
things like hardware shipbreaker
where I'm in zero-g everybody else place a keyboard and mouse I play controller
things like shooters it's absolutely can keyboard and mouse all the way you know there's no way I can play those of control
depends on the game
strategy games as well it's absolutely keyboard and mouse for them
it's just an option where
so it depends on the game in the game type
I don't have one overall preference for everything
it is about
what works best for that game
who is getting out of starting out with keyboard and everybody said to me no use controller so
so I give it a try
yes my dear play controller and I'm probably the fastest player
play controller
I'm was certainly one of the fastest player that plays controller
one of the best players at both controller
now we looking at
disease
we're going straight into a bottle going to me boss
escape on
goose fat
are they don't have that friendship breaker unfortunately
is that better quick
does that make you happy with
he has an awesome voice the narrator
The Barge
I dislike these blue things they are a nuisance
I give things in vulnerability they shouldn't have been more wealthy
yeah I don't workout to make him happy
Germany I completely walk past it and miss it
yeah the heavy soundtrack is excellent
ok I can just unlock in there
that works
Aztec the moon
yeah I know it's some
it has got anything yet
but it is still
early access in development so it may well get something in the future it's hard to say
play around online component accept the leaderboard
what have we got attacking it's chain lightning when you damage your phone
causes of burst of chainline
Iraqi take down in the restaurant by lightning
attacking exchange chain lightning
yes please
wearing makeup like a human adult female
this is going to help on the Minotaur fight
being over chain lightning things
hitting one or hit both
but they have to be within range of each other
I think
why will that pot not die
navigate
any darts
the truth will take the truth
you could scrape the leaderboard
10 to race so it wouldn't be much good for me
it might be interesting for some of the other viewers who also centre racing
tend to be quite interested in that
I have no idea what you just said that work
they can't figure out themselves
that's very kind of you
alright we can have gems for a minibus or a key without actually
we're gonna take the gems
the keys aren't so useful as the jams
mini boss
it's a very brave and slightly stupid thing to do
especially when I haven't got a way of deflecting his balls but
chain lightning should make short work of them
linings working
gyms UK
I thought I spotted a truth here now as what a shop
yeah we'll have our house
have a look around see if there's anything we forgotten
waxing pots
and also that's a nasty choice
that is a shot vs a hammer
Hannah is fantastic
shop is also excellent
it depends so I don't take change games every stream
I tend to change
to refuse treating so I'll sort of running I mean we did
couple of runs on
the previous game we were playing Sniper Ghost Warrior contracts would you like to hunt
a couple of hours number moving to Hades
it depends if we did some rocket league as well yes we played 3 or under fat
so when Ghost Warrior 2 rocket League and then into this very short succession
but there's other games I spent weeks and weeks and weeks on so it all depends on how I'm feeling and what I fancy playing next
and when I got things lined up
a tech tested whether I got a setup that will work with them
is Hunger Games I wanna play that I can't run
set up the way my current set at works
that'll be changing very soon when I get some turf
the woman that I can throw a bunch of different game some of them older some of them newer
tractor games in about point and berry things
this is a really tough decision
on the one hand record shop on a shop is always a decent
on the other hand I got a Daedalus hammer
which will give us a weapon upgrade
but we got a fight always to it and the shop is the part of least resistance
but the weapon upgrade is so tempting
going to be going into a boss after that and I think a weapon upgrade would be
better to take that or not
leaning towards the hammer which is a silly thing to do
but I think we're going to take it
take the hard work this time
booking office and health though
ok
Mohammed Usman fight
Amazon a shop
ok
Will Take That
special deals + 50% damage + 50% on recovery
putting on a mask with a spicy 35 hours on the field so far
attack strikes three times in a spread pattern that is useful
I think will take the triple
oh yes
we like that
an each of those does lightning damage as well or chain lightning damage
I'm going to a boss fight
we could go and see your favourite friend

trying to escape From Hell
I'm right now everything is trying to stop us including his bone hydra
slobbering with a spear
and it's gonna bring us
testified basically gives a sabonis life
so we can carry on fighting
it's taking a lot of upgrading together
and no worries auntie
there we go we have killed the linnea bone hydra

which means that I can check things out and have a look at the motor
so if you're not on my discord hop on that if you want on there
let us know as I put in the screen suggestion shall I might have a look at that
streamers battle to do and for those of you who are new to the screen welcome again
little game we play alongside our main game every stream
and it's actually what happens is I'm putting it down at the Beginning then half an hour later you guys are hopefully all put down 6 units each
and we go and have a battle with some of the AmEx now leave units in place by viewers except my one unit at the top there
I get to PL1 spell
so I'm going to drop a ranged damage spell here
ranged units a bit more boosted damage
and then we're going to start and we're going to see whether
the views of placed
hobbies in and around on the little bit
so with 38 alloys on that field
rock and roll
29 and 2 km at the top right
I got range damage boost so as long as the Range in it's a very close of that spell they get that damage boost
enemies and killing those beetles I got fairly tough armour

Monster House 10 thank you so much for that follow greatly appreciated
come to the stream of good see you
is battles going alright dog is currently sitting at the most kills but we're commands just knocked off the top spot stealing those top 3 if he stays there a little bit longer he's going to get a guaranteed reward for taking the most kills the most assist and the overall top spot
so which could happen
you have to take all 3 top spots to be guaranteed a reward right now Wickerman is taking all three of those top spots
but anything could happen in the next 30 seconds
is a stone left to kill
is France left to kill will Wickes stay on top
teamstuff reward
oh ok Monster House lovely to see you
your secret is safe with us don't you worry
that was indeed working overtime
so wicker man taking those kids with 12 the most assists will turn in the overall top spot
Wicker Man would you like a bomber scroll or would you like a bomber scroll
difficult decision to make a map
Thomas Colm Scott remember you
if you want to you can roll the dice
and you can see that way
when are you guaranteed one of them
it's just you need to choose which one you want
you took all three top 40 guaranteed reward that is the way this works on this chat

space monkey getting bored of waiting
space monkey gets the other scroll
quick channel policy if you take the most kills the most assists and thought you are guaranteed reward that is the policy and we got a state with the policy
rules to deal with an external we can't look a break in the market
that doesn't work
the space monkey world I'm getting that others don't forget folks and make sure you pick up what you got on the event track
anyone has not played this before about the stranger boss fight so this is your chance to get it you'll see a link pop-up in any second now

hit that link
someone over if you've not played stream Motors before it's completely free to play
replace a unit every 5-minutes for total of 6 over the 30 minutes between now and the battle
you need to login the twitch just to authorise it so that you know who you are and then you can start putting it down on the field with everything else
what I'm gonna do is on the throw my centurion down
Alice the boss fight so this is probably the hardest one we going to do with anytime soon
Wycombe parking the link the wrong link but the link all the same

I mean he's not wrong
to be frankly would have to change his name
as a statement of fact as much as anything else
there's lots of killing going on here which is kind of requirement in Hades
I'll take that money what's the shot got
the bonus health could be useful
dance have I got a shop coming up now got trial of the gods right yet we're taking the bone herself
trial of the gods is always the option to take in this situation
John of Gods is hectic and we need all the help we can get going into this
always always take the bone herself
intake Aphrodite first actually
yes Artemis pizza is that you
what do we fancy both of you both of very difficult I've already thought
he wants to see me so we made all fine Artemis
I think we're going to take
we haven't got a call yet and I think having a call is better than not having a call
so let's take
call I think
although 30% bonus life gays pretty solid
I Got a Feeling we're not going to pick up anymore bonus lifegain anytime soon though
having a call is the option because we didn't have one
she's grumpy
she's very grumpy
I mean she could say my forever
that's the problem with God's I got very very long memories
I do like the kind of disco with x that we got
I mean this is actually one of the less terrible goes to be fighting against nothing
all Things Considered there Are Worse ones
is Easter or discuss long as you stay outside of them and it seems that they don't affect you that much
he says he walks straight into them
and then walks train tomorrow them
let's have a boon
Teresa
what are we gonna take
I like that cost mod
but I like support fire even more
with anything it sends a seeking arrow
support fire is the one to take her
because even if you don't hit hard those Arrows give you some serious bonus damage
definitely won't take
and courses are held up
right after we didn't take the bonus health up
I look at that when I got chain lightning and bonus hours flying around
this is a damaged heavy right now
how many facts am I come out do ok

how to be on interpret testing as fact
to say nothing like each other
you were talking about
you disgusting earlier
do we take the day off to take the help it yeah we do
if you want to play with you but then
message
noted
what options is it going to give us
damage within bonus health
attack damage is good
damage or bonus else
I think we're going to take the bonus house
and it puts a straight into my boss lovely
let's have Artemis
Olivia
Harry Potter
oh dear
well we can have 10% crit
we can have
strike dealing bonus damage
good all that we can have a call yes will have a call
what do thing
don't try and cheat death
zego for us today
old baldy
healing would be a good idea
start Mr Darcy good idea no money
dark message = healing
yes that's the best option there
a turkey
and then smell
and then conveniently a shop
oh dear
what have you got in the shop today
anything interesting
we can't have all the things
I kinda want the health mostly though
I can take the health and I can take the darkness
indeed that is a battle it is that time
we're just doing a bit of shopping first because of its shopping is always important
gotta do you bit of shopping otherwise you can't do things
so we have
is a stinker of a run
let's like a house spell right in the middle this mess
42 hours it's a boss fight let's rock and roll
73 enemies we're going to get there
deck the Killing has commenced
the killing is occurring
so far glitter spots you're taking those top sports she's holding on to them
but not necessarily for long
not necessarily for long
KSP stealing the most kills there
is it going to hold on to them I think he is
I got the trifecta here we got ksv taking the most kills no I haven't got case we also taking another one spot and dirty box taken most assists so
is Rosie going out of random now ok
you was going to get 30 flying rogue
I can get 30 monks
I'm getting 50 flying rugs
Dobbies rewards going out of random
KSP gets the flying Rose glitter sparkly next
the monks enjoy those
Isles of scrolls good luck trying to read all of them but enjoy all those Scrolls
giving them
courses personal chests
good luck with those
we defeated the boss I got an army to upgrade
we definitely need to upgrade that flying road because
that's a lot of upgrades
yes is another upgrade
ok we got three upgrades out that was a decent run and got a wall beast up great
yes everybody has lots of scrolls on the good boss fights like that
so do let us know what you got in chat
it was a shiny shiny chest
drop back to Hades
a couple of minutes
where about to go into
we're going to see what happens
it's a time fight
140 Scrolls wow nice
who do you claim off
who should have had the unique them from
ok we got some cash there that's good
they will die
321
that's it we survived
you are Musketeers from Scrolls
so the Scrolls would have unlocked new things
only got a Douglas Emma
that is it for the 94 stream Raiders
because it's battle takes half an hour
we're going to do a couple more fights this
fully get to
the boss and maybe defeat the Boss and then call it there
we are coming towards the end of the night
this is more sensible with getting all the kills ourselves
not losing all to Santos
it's a much more sensible fight
I mean or appreciate if you could do something with some of these
crystal enemies
but yeah he's not doing so well this time
a 24-hour stream no
gastric deals bonus 60% damage added to the attack sequence
special becomes a flying kick
old special for for longer Range and up200 based at yes
Anthem health
and we got a shop
just been to a shop but we're going to go to another shop
because that means that with them going to be approaching the boss fight
just keep asking well
I don't know
I don't think it's likely
answer fishing spot let's do some fishing
forget the fish
there is no petition command
no case we we don't need a position command
I think I should be taking the
healthier
am I going to go and do a boss fight
we're going to find Meg
come on Mac
ok yeah that's ridiculous
that is a ridiculous alternative ability there
and makes down
navigate
but this one what we're going to do is
switch on trinket because we need to sort of drink at this point
we need the house
this is the point
barbecue music
because it is that time of the night
I want to write so please do sit around for that
have a look see who we're going rate
it is going to be
whatever Ryan
with a great response from the other night when we went to see him so we could go see him again
the front of Article the big taco he's playing space engineers tonight
different game
he will appreciate it I will appreciate it I will see you again tomorrow night
stick around for taco
I'll see you tomorrow night 8 as usual
stay safe stay in touch and I'll see you on discord
I I ok you doing great to see you
very good evening happy Sunday
are you doing today bye I was going well
I got all the guys in tonight
good to see you mate how you doing
and most importantly has your PCV more stable since that by 6
yeah I'm doing good I'm doing good
has a ring stabilizer been since lost since the wedding
unacceptable you have to shut the Hollywood if I shouted the unfortunately it would be a bit too loud and would definitely
and I'm running a compressor
Don't Impress myself enough that the shape wouldn't be heard
exactly when acceptable
it is good Sunday evening
what is a stream
one more crash today to white screen and windows to the whole fixing repairing thing
ok that's not ideal
we need to apply a large hammer to that at some point
surridge at the it should behave itself
definitely need to encourage you to behave yourself a bit better
indeed Diss
turn over an hour trying to get us so we hope it was some ready x
because that's a lot of time to spend it wasn't something Revenue
was Aaron you congratulations
kksb Hayden
get to seamer
Casey of course being or chief engineering taking the background
making your classical things work including
to do some work on a Sunday for someone where are you now
in the broadcast business the world never sleeps
yeah conditions on radio are awful
that we know
whenever he's not going to be the worst next weekend for field day as well
anyway
but I'm we just strange 3 m
this bottom path there is a little token just that we might have a chance of getting wet if we go for it
in short order we might just get there by the end of the night
so what have you got a place to Monks tonight ok place in Monks we can definitely do
rise of the circle that is not a monkey
there's a monkey with a tiny spot
opera monk
what about here because apparently these weeks in months
I don't know what he's gold coins are but
leasing reasonable and close and so we'll go for them as well ajb rocket how you doing
I'll see I don't want to get opinions from chat that's a dangerous thing to do
the very dangerous thing today
we might get an opinion later on the screen when Charles a bit busier
I do very special let's go and take a look now
play Rocket we're doing good we're doing good here
stream Raiders tonight starting with caution wet floor
there should be a safety sorry about this
a foodbank line how you doing it's good to see you
welcome welcome welcome
famous great to see enjoyed alert thanks for coming in
hope you're doing ok as woman
we are going to text down a bit and I'm going to head straight to Hades
I'll be giving you a suit Lee
this is
rough when you start
but it is not rough after you've been getting there for a while
you've got to get some of those upgrades in so for example
trinkets
and I definitely want to switch to this trinket call you on the 3rd because this one gives me the bonus
drops when are we doing at top of screen after I've had some time to spend learning mats
ASP trigger in that bossy Media
I feel like I'm going to need to spend some time learning and maps before we stream that because otherwise it's going to go horribly wrong I mean to go horribly wrong anyway
just sold and shipped I give half a year email couldn't be sent because for some reason it wouldn't have sent from a disconnected account
oh yeah Hades is huge
there is a lot to do in Hades
the story
of which there is plenty
ABBA is a huge game and yes do bring friends friends are good
only blood and nobody is addictive
you're not wrong
I could learn on string but I don't think learning and maps on streamers why I think learning everything else on stream is nice
if I turn the maps on stream
well no but has confidence
no what would you have said if not what I said I was going to be rubbish
I just want to see me tonight a chat always want to see me die
that is what chat do isn't it
I'm in Turn to Stone I have got a call
a couple of organs that are getting in the way
this is not going well so far
to dodge the fireballs
the dog in as well
let me know said the Golden Gorgon will come out of the fire of it so we can actually get somewhere near it
where is at the moment
I can't go into that fire
otherwise it will kill me
yes I gonna need it to come towards me a bit and it's gonna refusing to go again
are the spells to do the job that we go
you wrote that properly the boats been up for nearly 8 days blimey
you did something properly
no far you can go into
why am I not surprised why am I not surprised off
Zoella it's someone's upset her
why she not singing
what is you're not singing
she's not carefree anymore about me
that's have to Boons upgraded
and we got a prophecy foretold
so has been pushed to rare
that's being pushed away that's ok that will do nicely
I'll definitely take a bit of that as epic
early hours playing with another string Leone what's 2 million rubles most of your cousins
like to lose 2 million rubles all My Guns On My First Run
there's a burrito there I need that
so this is a Fist run
complete with an Artemis moon on the Artemis boonies excellent
Artemis god catering anyway
do need a dash deflect
because at the moment I got no defence against smells
I'm not gonna be problematic soon
so I quite like the finer and finer doing at some point with a defect on it
weather enemigo
I think I would if it's over there
when I do that
and not nice there's any messages
Rapids additional studies useful
faster attack with these Facebook giraffidae anyway that is solid Will Take That
oh yes this is definitely the right choice set
absolutely definitely the right choice
how we can take a minibus or we can go to shop shop is very definitely the correct thing to do
bksb to ask for 18 hours
is this some kind of thing they're only ksbs like to propose in that you can't propose
we have no money so we're going to take but we can afford
especially since we're going into my boss
which minibus are we going to get this time we're going to get The Barge
YouTube stay still
right now that's all of them out
this is definitely not looking like a good one so far
health is a little bit on the low side here
we should indeed go
let's take a boon
little godling
I'm not sure that's the right way to win my affection
I'm not sure it's all about that
little godling
what do you have bonus damage on the attack
bonus damage on the cast of but it changes to a short range of blast or extra life
Max health regen
I think they wanna take a tank does more damage
Seamus popping back in temporarily
how is ksbs job as the alpha in the relationship right ok
I wasn't going to ask
I'm still not asking
ok but central heart
and a fountain
it doesn't eat us all the way but he was a bit
and a burrito
that wasn't the easier in counters in this game
munchies are there any shiny things go get told off if I don't do a shiny things no there aren't there is a shop
a shop that we still have no money for
that's ok cuz the shop also means no fighting
unless we borrow from Karen which we're not gonna do
we can't afford both
we can
or we can get an upgrade
do boss fight
I got a feeling the over here would be better
fairly effectively most of the time
so I think we're going to take the upgrade
I'm going to take the damage boost
tack
that because we need to be doing a damage
you mean you think he's flying to meet us one day
ok what have we got here
ok well that's also him enough that he said he's coming back again
have indeed met stranger people
listening to be working alright
it's just left dashi run
and delivery saving the dog age
excuse me
let's have Artemis in here to finish this off
hey Jimmy welcome
Dorothy store
yeah baby how you doing Jimmy love is a burrito
good to see you buddy
your weekend in happy Sunday we are indeed causing more havoc
and mayhem and a bit of death and destruction
it is of course Hades
we are fully here again
what is a shop got
we haven't got a lot of money anyway
weekend's been good how about me it's Day 2 of a 3-day weekend so we're doing pretty well I've got another day off tomorrow which is nice
public holiday in the UK got a love it
so all Things Considered it's been another relaxing day
what on earth will you say the Jimmy there because that was not a command
what are we celebrating end of summer
we just have a public holiday in the end of summer for the for the heck of it
and if we want to take the summer
eating a prawn studying
what are the prawns think about the situation
that's enough about thank you very much
definitely not be having any of this going on
Daedalus hammer
attackers more Range and deal 10% damage
yes
I'll take that
all that is a range booster and a half that is nice
that is definitely Range Rovers that we like
Argos you want to take them myself
dwarf with jokes like that you know what's coming next don't you
you know what's coming next

let's take some money
how much money do we get with 92
author DJ do you like Jimmy
as a cool down I'm afraid
night buses tonight
RC this is unreasonable
is very unreasonable
I got the choice of a shop or Encounter at the shop is handy but the encounter is always a worth asking to do especially when this one can give me back

there you go
is give me a broken spearpoint
tell me the basic synopsis ks4 trying to escape From Hell
and Hades are trying to stop you and you gotta fight everything
replenish testify
bonus life or extra damage replenish testify
that is something that you can't get accepting a shop that very expensive
minibus or
you're poison Knight with his name on it
I need a one
is that you in the head the other day man twice
I get a shop why can't you see at
as pots
4 as a noise no
what do we want
I think will take reduced damage
ultimate or crumble
she doesn't like it when we pick somebody else
yeah ok that still hurts
these little circle things are annoying because
you can avoid dying is by dodging Ireland which is difficult when there are so many so close together
and the traps
the transit also fire so you can't just ignore them
and you're trying to kill all the enemies
don't do helpful things like coming to you and standing
they will insist on standing right by the traps
that's what happens if you don't kill the souls quickly enough
so we got there
yeah I've had about 45 followers from different host accounts
not a lot we can we do about it
they turn up they do that thing
stuck increases good but any damage is good too
money omnibus
the money was not a minibus when there's a shot coming up
approach
yes will take that house
I thought I dodged at the range of that not into it
ok
meticulous
yeah it's the apostrophe that confuses them
I don't know exactly how that come and work so whether it's possible to escape close
that was the one that was made for me
potteries definitely confuse it
I'm going to the gym this year
even though it's another me boss
and this is very bad for my health totals
we still don't have a dash deflect
already kind of defect
are we using the trees to good effect and hiding behind them
behind the trees and the things can't get us
gems taken
is there any Health over here anywhere because we could really do with some
we are severely lacking and health department at this point
options
Jimny boss
20 bus
don't herself a panda balls good to see you
yeah notebook command language using delimited but it works

that wasn't very nice
I know I replaced my desk device that doesn't mean I want them taken away again
bloody stream notice so we'll do without the end of this encounter assuming we survive that Mum
we should do
I say we should do that's optimistic
I'm thinking positive here
are you come back
yeah meetings that long are just cruel anyway
instant Max health gain
innocent treasure all the treasures cheap
I would like a shop at some point that we haven't got one
and the 25 life without restoring health is
useful but not as useful
I Will how you doing good to see you
welcome welcome welcome
I doing this evening
this nectar
but if you get all 3 top sports then you are guaranteed one of the prizes
play the stream Raiders are on
that's all you're guaranteed
will spread to see how you doing tonight
history
yes right shopping
ok will be restored almost all of my house
with that dark this we will guarantee ourselves the last bit
back the right time it was a bad going to boss my so
take the darkness
take the upgrade
I think the
1% damage
the random boon what we got in the random Boon
what have we got
that's even damaged inflating we could be good week affect some more potent
just leaving damage definitely
I didn't have one of those yet
and we're going in for a boss fight
declared this box with the First Once
it never cleared the end with this with the piss so
righteous Fury there's a big words
PCS in series
write if you could avoid
irritating place
that's all the annoying things with these guys this
as well
I'm really sorry I should be waiting for my god gauges maxed out but
3 L with a dog gates helps
fancy trying not to die this is not going to well
yeah I'm not going too well
and he has this rather annoying shield
let's get Artemis to deal with that
oh and he's got the sidemen
have to justify this this is not going well
OK Google how you doing
it is going decidedly badly
yep decidedly Batley and 8
who fast rabbit is
I am not at all sure if asked rabbits but if they get involved with things and that's good
Morrissey the name stream Otis
no hypnosis we didn't
Hades is grumpy
punctuality
director of pensions at random viewers

if you're a burger tree you wouldn't share either
whataburger trees that like purgatory any different
next somebody going to tell the joke about the bacon tree
what idea doesn't need a sub doesn't need me to sub
Forbidden Fruit
ok we have
shield Ash
we have attacked you alright actually yes
and that was chaos I heard
for a free balloon
indeed did get drinks off
yeah I think we want
increase I think it'll take the Palm that doesn't involve having a minibus to deal with
hello I give you speaking these things just as annoying and minibuses
I love this is basically playing pinball now
yes will take a boot on that or a boost on that bin
what's the shop got in it
now will pass on them
shopping needs to be done at the correct opportunity
are we still got a minibus of white would you still Aries
where we go
so full run JP I think
is something between 50 and 60
12 per
normal b
but then when you end up closer to the end and you going to the temple of Hades you can potentially get it done in as quick as two rooms or it can take up to 5 room sets
variable but this is
coming towards the end of the first twelve I think it is
deals more damage
seven diesel damage
12 before you get to each boss
we can check the some status that the game will show me with later on
answer fishing spot and we can't fish yet but
as a fishing spot for later
Take That
does all the things I have chaos
cast of good will do the fishing
that was quick normally it does 304 jump before you get the fishing
again with the encounter vs shop
the Encounters of the better option to take
these Encounters of course are included in the list of rooms and Jimmy getting a drink in there
I don't think this item does salt free water
a Mexican grumpy
or dude
healing
oh Darkness is healing
I think we take Darkness does not lose his healing
and now we take gyms
as a shop there
now your notice I'm not getting health out of these parts because I'm not carrying a drink it gives me hot health
all the same we smash the box anyway
just in case
more money was smash the postcode for Germany in the way
as of the enemies
anime start with
what does a mini Shop got
wicker bonus l for cheap
yeah let's take the bonus selfie cheap
especially since about to get money again in the next room
this is indeed
Eddie Large
I do like the Chill sing on this
that's having some nice extra button a stuff
so what have we got we still got another one of these hands here
these findings are annoying because if they get too close to you then you get changing place
money always good
with a shop as the next option
they always take the shop where the shop is available except in certain situations but usually we take the shop
what are we going to take we have enough money for all the things
all things
yeah I think it Ash that deals damage is good
has taken upgrade
let's upgrade are everything damage
take some more House
I'm going to my boss
if I know we're going to full boss
first 12 Chambers done
alecto doesn't like us
she's a bit grumpy
link sister against sister that's a brave move
playing sister against sister is a very brave and dangerous move
that was not an attempt to kill myself early on there was an attempt to get to the
unfortunately had the side effects of landini on spikes which was very bad for me
outrageous not a good thing we reduce that rages much as we can
when she gets Reggie and that's not very pleasant thing to see
there's rage
rate which involves spinning blades of death
Birches Head
it is a three Sisters of Fury
you got Meg you've got
Persephone and you've got the sister who just killed whose name I've already forgotten
ok we're going to go back to the house
definitely want the health Boon
trinket
to buy a list of them
ok for the moment
you know where is a frog enjoy
I'll see you later
get both together as units down
we have 7 minutes left until the next battle
I heard chaos ice chaos
with Max health which is the best time to take chaos
especially now we have the year
drink it off give me health
what is Chaos coronavirus
that's right deals bonus damage yes please
that is Louis
asteroid doing damage it is definitely the way
especially with this weapon where dash strike is the optimal
choice
even if it hurts me more before we get to that point
it is not necessary now anyway dashing a lot is a good thing
on account that have all the lava that you and at walking in
but we're making a start
no my outside bones are the only option
we are pretty low in the money department
it's frustrating getting to a shop without any money
let's take some money this time
you've got a cursed knife
which idiot thought was a good idea to give you a knife
hey Jeremy how you doing
Peabody
make a right mess of the place as usual
how is he killing so many more than I am
obviously been supercharged
is obviously been supercharged this time
yeah we're not beating him
we never beaten that
take that hello
alright alright
and shop
I have no idea who that is or what that is
and you know that dwarf
you're just being difficult
yeah what are the Boom
I'll take the 8
take the darkness elf
I just like this minibuses minibuses a nuisance
luckily with the Shield playing pinball like this
makes me a lot harder to hear
stampy and the lava very bad idea
well we got
understanding perfect in would be handy but we got to find fountains to use
you stepped in the last earlier because you had 20 Max else that was a silly choice yeah you're not wrong that is a silly choice
taking less damage is a wise option in this situation
we are taking plenty of damage and she's a problem
unfortunately
we've got an encounter with a character
you sing again
yes Paul decision don't step in the lava
I mean up show you what happens when you do
all hands on YouTube
yeah the runs today well you shouldn't have had that curry last night then
yeah that's great
spoons
and then go to the shop
broccoli on a head
I think should be grumpy if she heard you say that
ok well we going into the bone hydra
we should probably buy the extra house
this is possibly not going to go well because we are low on myself and we don't have a huge amount of balloons
fashion choice
go to vegetable
broccoli is broccoli is not a passion fruit is a vegetable
extreme Motors coming out
that is 3 m will deal with that as soon as we've beaten the learning bone hydra
we're just chilling out quite nicely
the waste of a Godzilla TV
online
it's time you died matey
where abouts did I
we are definitely back to die
as expected
predictably reliable
too much lava
another one down
and another one
no gotta hope that we can just get
what is another head I thought we taken out of our heads over here
I'll come along
or will take that kill
the fifth doctor with the scream what
disagreement broccoli Bean a vegetable I don't think anybody would disagree the broccoli is a vegetable
every knows that broccoli is indeed a vegetable
show me happened you saw him yesterday and it made you think of me what happens Johnny
what happened in the story today that made you think of me
I'm giving airstream writers most jammy answer that question
broccoli is a small tree I think what you mean is that broccoli is treemendous
anyway moving swiftly on with some paste
we are going to get this kick off
36 hours on the field
hey Dante
rock and roll
KSP on subs I'm not surprised

rules around mksp getting 50 gold extra metric again block couple of paladin Scrolls Dwarf been getting 25 gold
six and I get a Barbarian
good luck in those personal chest as always
get the kick off straight away
what are we doing we are still doing flag bearers
we are still in Monks monks are on cooldown will put another flight bear down here
get me some
most units only finish fourth blank as B
KSP
we'll get back to Hades
Wilko shop to investigate
if we can't afford to buy
justifies from
we have no destefanis left
so we need to rely on
getting that
encounter part way through the character to get lead actor Faisal replenished
that is the only other way we're going to do this
I won't get all through those testifies replenish that will help

I probably good reasons for that
achutam you got poison knife
nice
ok let's take that
the command but didn't earn it
right actually yeah I see how it is normal the optimal choice
my concern the audience of getting stabby the audience is always stabby

no it's never the last of them

there are many of them
and the Pop I want I'm not at all surprised about
not in the slightest
ok I can afford both of these
hell's next time so that's ok
excellent that was what I was hoping for
money doesn't grow on trees but apparently do
excuse you
giving stuff invulnerability is not allowed
especially when I don't have a dash strike
I don't have a dusty flex
I'm not seen enough seen up for awhile actually
diving resort in last run
this is not looking positive
you get really good run sometimes not so much so
this is not a good life amount to have
that is what we want though that is an Encounter
this is the encounter we hoped would get
first time you passed first boss congratulations
nicely done
listen kangaroo just saved our bacon
we have a prediction what prediction do we have
how can I see the first part I can see as far as give to something the next to
what are we predicting
the next to what
I will not talk of game absolutely
not talk of is the best knock off
I think we're going to be taking
all the best defiance
three of them
and I want to take with dual-beam again I really do
we got extra lives we're going for the Auburn
we're gonna lose one of them immediately
I have 43 help this is not a good amount of health
we're gonna lose
testifies immediately
we got enough that we can afford to do that
I think we're going to take
first
don't get hit that's a valid approach toastie
of the using desk defined do 22% more damage that Encounter
Badoo
Dionysus is not happy
he never does
none like you picking her brothers and sisters
always purple things of festive fog
burrito
no regeneration for you
all for you
who's still alive
no regeneration it was inevitable
luckily we picked up enough that we can afford one
I'll come along will you stop that
thank you
smoking fish is valid
I don't think wrong number one needs to be worried about
oh hello
he seems like a good thing to have
guarantees at least half house after every Encounter
we have to take the path of least resistance
definitely taking the path of least resistance
I really love to see the finer boom turn up
I'd love something to be given me a defect
I'm not seen leaderflex for a while
now the wrong time to dash
very definitely the wrong time to dash
there is a lot of fashion going on here because I want to try and stay out the way of everything as much as I can although very often involves we dashing into things instead

that would give me 90 helpful I'll give you 25 up and 25 replenished
sec maybe
I just responding to electro my extra metrica she wanted to drink
this is a tough choice
on the plus side I could have 90 extra health
the house is going to be option
because we're going to last night we need the house
what this means when we do stream ages and then I'm going to phone them prediction as well
appoint
don't upset the ball

I say burn we got chill but
burn and chill work together

GK sky plump helmet the study on
is a good job that weeks not around
Jamia we taking screenshots and sharing that with work shortly
totally obviously feeling nice
very nice
love me coworkers what UK work is done now
yes all damage has chance to do crit
now we have an option here
we have
ping a pig sound like a fishing spots
I definitely herping
where is the fishing spot
why do I not see a fishing spot
where's the thingy
up in the huge let me to scroll me scroll
like to pay attention
this efficient Scotland talking straight past
let's do the fishing
not too early
no have a choice we can either take that June 450 coins
go back into one of these tunnels
possibly this on with the minibus
and try and some more coinage
with which to buy a something else
like the only indus Daedalus thing is great
but it's completely random so it takes away one thing at random and give you two other things at random
amazing would be awful
the Forge
looking at the party we have no testifies I don't think would be beating Hades anyway
and there's no way to recover them now
so the choice is either do we go back into another one of these Chambers
or do we
take the Boom that we got here already
and then go and fight Hades anyway but either way
choice after stream Raiders
because I got to do that first
also
need to do this prediction
somebody else
in the next 20 minutes
I guess I better choose the outcome
the outcome was a belief yes
complete that
prediction completed Cash help me handle height
stream Raiders is up we are going to throw
steinhagen we have 38 Amazon the field let's rock and roll
no I didn't I just deleted one message
what an extra can you earn some points
nice to see glitter spots at the top of the tree
looking good there
doing some damage doing some killing
yes and thank you so much I'll follow welcome great to see how you doing
how are you doing Jess
is fantastic to see here
replacement streaming right now but we play that in between games
so we have little spots taking the most kills with 14 live sports taking overall talkSPORT as well and jammy taking the most assists with 5
can you detect all three of these top sports and guaranteed a reward if they don't they got a random
paint Runner Pro
free robux and jammy pick-up free robux
Javier picking up 5 Gold including me and of course there's a personal chest so best of luck with those
getting straight on in again caution wet floor again
I'm sure we saw this at the beginning of the year
wet floor is a thing to watch out for what have we got we need to put another month down
have here another month
another monkdown that is a quest complete
request window on we need to hand my email can you go beyond the window and upgrade the great was a Jerry
always upgrade the great was a cherry
Jurys Inn Bolton
anyway go to Quest window
turn in your quests get your rewards in this case 50 gold
god is good
and of course then get yourself back to placing your units
we are going to head back to Hades
some reason is very dark
there is a bit less dark
I think this is we take the boot on the head straight in
I think that
deals more damage in Flix week
a good call
weekly frozen horses at water damage is also a good call
and the week
longer duration
do we have any give week at the moment anyway
if you're not doing anything with week anyway then those two are worthless
highest Ash give week
that is heroic wow ok
managed to get a heroic sash
but if that is making things a week anyway
then it seems to me like a fine idea
for us to increase the damage vs week
and of course keep Cypress happy
chat always run tamaki chat always random Ark
it's normal
why asking toastie
sledmore zippity

I need to learn to spell dwarf but you know
I suspect as a special response only given when dwarf and the command
we know what KSP is like
that is not good we're already at 40% health
we have no desk device
he does
I don't think they give very well it didn't go very well
why is the heart being rebooted
who's rebooting geeky what's going on
not on
steady on toasty steady on
you know
all clinical
that's alright Elvis
have a quick look around see if there's any news on here on family toasters being grumpy
Rule number one of this game
duck
is always always pet the dog
ojp if you still around
I will show you a couple of things
so in the administrative chamber which you get your fine in the store in a bit later
10 things you can do after you unlock it again
as you can see your escape attempts
and they tell you various different things
so you can see I've done 55 attempts so far
and you can see your permanent record
I can see your weapons and armour
you can hear me motivational
is the shakes don't appreciate they don't like you being motivational
however
don't you know we got something share with the chef so let's do that
yeah assassin rewards sometimes nice
in here
you have another handy thing
come back to there in a minute
are you coming to the weapon room
this way
can you stand at the end of here and stop and wait
when you stop and wait
this happens
and it tells you the furthest chamber you've reached
toastie getting a drink in the course
so that's what I call little thing you can see how far you got on previous runs
Bible series chamber 55 which I presume is the enter chamber
useful thing for you to be able to check up on
are we getting a sword run it's been a long time since we have a sword run
Marty long
let's change this packs to nothing because we don't need it for the sword
so there's recover handy things you say no by you can see how far you've got how many chambers each time and soul
what does IRS can give us
ok
dash transfer blade ripple you started
useful
I didn't actually need to hit them then the blade with did all the work
and Chaos has arrived before you and started
sent me into some rocket League towards the end of the Strain
probably not this evening
I don't like to stick with one game for the whole stream rather than switching it up halfway through
maybe next time maybe
I might do some tarkov map learning tomorrow
I do need car on the bike for a bit but I might do some maths learning as well
what is Chaos offering me
we can get bonus gems and darkness his health
are we gonna boosts or
I think you'll have the bonus bonus and bonus gems
which night which will get a bonus for now on but
you need some help so will take some Darkness
see what we might be looking after fine later
is there's a Daedalus hammer mod for this weapon
would used to Great effect in the past
but Everytime We hit something we get health back immediately
is incredibly overpowered mod
it does reduce your Max health overall
but we found herself for every hit
it becomes worth it very very quickly
more Darkness yes please
don't think you needed at what meeting
toastie ksb and Casey's wife
steady on
I would avoid the toastie coming to the UK or KFC and is he going to Canada
which ever happens bring me back a drivers Chili Peppers way
thank gonna game
fake gauntlet is nothing fake about this
I'll have you know this is all Jimmy's got
is a very real
ripped off when you work for ramp ok
if you do visit the UK you'll have to let us know
swapping party steady on
what are you soliciting geeky
I didn't know this was that kind of chat
what kind of channel is this
an even without the bonus health on hits this sort is pretty handy as a weapon
the majority my damage that has been taken by me standing on spikes
boosted blade Rift
and some more Darkness
wholesome Animal Crossing
give me Mrs and wholesome
I wouldn't worry about Casey's opinion of you nobody else does
even case he doesn't worry about Casey's opinion of people
excellent chaos is upgraded herself and we got in canter
he said
again with the Brittany references
what's it going off this time the usual things
and Jake's rain PX thank you so much for the Fallout
welcome
address Hider
grape seed
thanks for that follow earlier
how you doing tonight
add the restraining earlier
if I was going to get a shout out for just an O2 please
Spotify earlier on another friend's discord server and yeah she was dreaming doing a great job
shoutout let's say hello
ey25
good to see you buddy
yeah
have to varnish in order to be able to
which is why I can stick around to the end unfortunately
but it's great see you here welcome
I think you're looking for information hi Robin exclamation hello
thank you KSP greatly appreciated
project estimator right
she was playing
but I've never seen before
I can pick you forgot my name all fully evolved running around as a fox try to solve puzzles and things
which was really fun
that spirit of the North I should read my own Shadows they tell me what came with us
there you go
I know what happened toastie was the ksb beat you to it by about half a second
and it run it as once every 30 seconds maximum
so you did it right you just did it slightly slow
so it works fine
take some Darkness
it's not it is also healing
and his owner self
yeah but the voice controlled shout out but will only shout out for the last Raider and just didn't read me which is why I need Emmanuel chat site
is there any calls out the last raid
inspire unusual request for
when we sort that usually stout then we'll be able to work make you guys completely redundant
we'll work on that later
this is of course Hades we are running around it is a great game
brilliant at it but I have a lot of fun with it
what are we going into next we're going into a mini boss
I think we can afford to take the moon rather than worrying about the health at this point
Dennis is gonna be a nice little give us
baboon
mistake in attacked in Flix chill
we could take the darkness
saving money is a good thing here
let's do that
is well worth playing
Anisa minibuses and they're rather annoying minibuses so this get it rapid and manic
is it going to kill them as quickly as we can otherwise I just gonna throw things at this
and the more things they trust the more hurts
which is why I'm doing things like dashing around jumping blade Rift around him
is a labourer skills lots of damage for them as well
uksb
oh yes let's have a god I'd
so one of the things we've got here is we have a voice controlled Bolt

that rock putting up a big fight the enemies underneath the wrong being killed
area
they never unsolicited when there's a picture there's a channel just for animals it's never unsolicited have cat pics in a pictures for animals
we have extra metrical taking the top spot the most assists but being knocked off that reflecto by Scallon
symetrica you could have had the whole thing
the guarantee draught as it is it gone out of random
can you pick up a fly rogue anyway
latest boxer getting a paladin in jammy getting couple of Barbarians
6 gold 15 for me and of course those personal chests
Unix time

another two flag bearers is a thing that we can achieve
it is not unachievable
we will get there
we will get there
so
what we going to do now we are going to get back to Hades
and we could pick up some more Darkness
Darkness is good
to health
and in this run
start Mrs some without all the runs and I think
start m also Max Health Plus
which we like Mac selfless is always a solid and a half
there I was trying to get out of it and I got it might anyway
lead singer annoying for that
they will dump exploding pots right where you kill them
another exploding pots everywhere else as well
there's too many parts around the place
ok
can pictures have been uploaded discord excellent
I mean you can't pictures or are they old cat pictures
is an important question we know the answer to
Zeus auto shop
first
smallpox history
the boxer dead
I think we take this shop because the shop means we don't have a fight first
I will check out the cat picture
a shop where you can go fishing that's unusual
are we going to go fishing in the shop
normally by the fish from the shop
but we can go fishing in the shop
slovaks
burritos always handy
what have we got
is offering a car on fight
we could have Karen fight
nothing before we even consider doing it Aaron fighting
we should probably have some health up
we're going to have minibus anyway so may as well have
devos
pictures from 2020 noted
let's upset to you boss
Karen the boatman
I like the music we get here is his shop music
he takes a lot of killing this guy
you're not very happy
I wish you put his or away
don't worry you don't actually have to fight Karen ever
unless you choose to
Arsenal thing
if you do choose to
you get a massive discount on your old shop purchases from this point onwards
although it hurts a lot
Andy kills you quite a lot
is the green Decatur from doing badly get to see Mum probably can do badly against Heidi later as well
yeah that was not good I walked into it rather than away from it
ok we are hoping that we're going to kill him before he kills us
this is not looking likely right now
no it wasn't likely
that paddle doesn't hurt a lot
is strong
couple of times wick we have beaten in the first couple of times before 2
cheeky swine
pet the dog
always pet the dog
yeah so we're confirm beat him two or three times and di2 and twice
and it was cerberus the cause of devastation not us
he does have a face um beard
yeah so we're gonna run through again
no more wins but we've got there a couple more times
I think we done free Haley's boss bikes now
which is an improvement
extreme measures
or Yorkie
3 wins and 30 runs
yeah I am getting closer to 60 round the sun already got one with hello dated persuasion yes well upgrade that
what weapons are going to offer a system for a run
SSP run

ok
yeah I'm going to take a run without new techniques
I got no problem to deal with it as it is
c w
my offers
this is one will use a tackle lot
so having a tack that inflicts chillies
worthwhile
biggest chill at course slow them down
straight into the darkness room
Darkness taken so starting rewards because of our upgrades give us maxlife upgrades as well
excuse me
I was not very nice of you
kill Darkness Darkness
starters for all the house
yeah so basically if you chill them the things you can essentially stun lock them
and yeah we got a bit of dementia it wasn't a huge amount
I take the Boom rest time
normally the max health but the moon seems like a wise option
as a chaos skates
what's Zeus coronavirus
yeah chain lightning cast
what is a shotgun
nothing worthwhile just get we got want to save our money for it later
yeah let's do a chaos
chaos is usually quite cool give us some nice things
there's a shiny thing I'll get told off I don't examine

I have seen the face it looks more like a bowling ball
don't know what is a reference to
war we got we got the Blake dash again which is nice
if you take damage of Doom yes
doom is always a good thing to reflect
no game burning Rock of Ages
I must have been to the Rock of Ages it is a real Rock
that's not what you're thinking of
you think I like the humour of those games
is it terrible humour or is it good humour
is breathedge was recommended to me on account of the Terrible humour
which is very appropriate
slapstick B Monty Python ok that see usable then eventually
ok shop or health and there's only shot what's my shotgun
nothing that we really
want let's take the big shop
Lyceum of the big shops here there's also using a phantom in any shop
by the way all Daedalus hammer hello
special special special
yeah that one
I'll take that helps
in the we going into darkness anyway
armour damage is best in your opinion
I don't use a special that much
all the damage only applies for a short time where us
normal damage of life for everything
I said I don't tend to use a special much does it usually ends up with me getting hit a lot
like that
draining heater not a lot even it's not a good thing to have
by the way it was gonna be a rubbish one but
I think we should probably take the trial of the Gods
is it not going well
Zeus odometer
I think we will take
the fishing
fishing is a good chat
I think we need to take dermatuff us because I've heard zeus's much easier to fight and Emma Terrace
oh very nice we're going to call effect
I can't down Zeus calm down
upset well that's one way of putting it
is certainly not thrilled
that's how that works ok
that's how that works
what are you offering us
dash causes a lightning bolt
and up to 150 gold yes please
barely got through
we only lost 14 gold that was supposed to be good ending especially the shop coming up
that was possible to the best and English had so far that
what's next
we can afford most of this stuff I think we should definitely take the house
I think we should definitely take the Who spoon
what effects also make Photoshop 2DS
that is what I was thinking work
show me this halfway to a book command
I doing anyway Seamus
yeah we don't kill you
father of set her
so electos you're under table dream and if she work
you're only setting for mate because she can't have elected
is that what you want what I'm hearing you
what you say that but you know
I'm not sure we can believe that
that's appointment I picked up this one what does this give me
impervious to damage for 1 second after you take damage
now we're going to stick with the health
yeah
however I need the house that juices chicken drink it gives me
I definitely need the help Dusit drink it gives me more
it is a much more solid approach
hello how I can mostly Windows battles by dashing now
movespeed
oh yes I hustle definitely
money is something we always seem to struggle with
always Struggle for the money
other half will be helpful probably gonna take the house
Hermes Dowson Exxon boots
pretty good ones
I feel like the zoo spoons and the area spoons could make you very very powerful very very quickly
waste of a good shot
between doom and jolted I feel like you can do a lot damage incredibly fast
indifferent I welcome great to see you
thank you so much for that following welcome to the
how to chat how you doing tonight
I suspect I know which nerve you are it is good to see you buddy
it's good to see you indeed
have you seen Hades before
is this a game you played before or seen before
we have not got
as much as I'd like
what are we go coming on as we have Amy boss
yeah you're playing you like me getting ok sounds good
at least you know I'm not going to take that actually I'm going to save the money
it is a cheap random Boon
but at the moment I have got the money for both and I wanted the Maxell Cup
the maxhealth off is always a solid choice
we know what I'm like without
that's ok yes only started playing with keyboard and mouse
she told not to I was told his better for broken shoulder
the extra movement and the extra directions
is wsd limit you a lot in terms of your directionality movement
so whilst I started out on controller
she recommended I stop and I switched sorry keyboard is recommended I stop and switch controller
so I guess you're playing on hard mode
an interesting I mean it's personal preference
oh hello
ColdFusion duo yes please
it's absolutely personal preference but the point was made to meet was with keyboard and mouse or other with keyboard specifically you only get WS and easy directions
with the controller you've basically got wherever you can put your analogue stick
he came running Full Circle so that something to be aware of
feel like I can do all these directions
which you can't really do with keyboard and mouse
72 fire
I'm going to ring Into The Fire
I got a pomegranate pom with Groupon
8 mins Infinity
what is personal choice of course
an extreme take care that as soon as we finish this battle

ethernet has done its sting
I'm on learning
temperature candy with those two
and then we can help me deal with this one
and we can Vanquish the Lennon bone hydra
then get some more Darkness
Animal health
and moves 50 onwards to stream Raiders
well we have a decent number of animals on the field
we have to cause we have a small corner in Lidl have small car on the edge recorder on the engines be in the middle quicker
let's make that happen 55 hours on the field
hey sweetie just dropped a grenade on you and took off that wasn't very friendly of him
you're a word isn't that that is not appropriate behaviour
grenade is best friend in tarkov
outrageous
is there a well on this low
if you take all the topics we got somebody else on the assist at the moment
I got a couple of people coming up towards those kills as well
a scammer and you didn't have the knife
oh lovely
we've got a decent number of allies still killing here
this is looking good
it is looking fantastic good this is looking at the Massacre
your KFC with my skills of 13 we got sign up with the most assists with the 11th OK speak with 17 holes at random extra magical picked up three flying Rogues Wicker Man picks up the 50 gold and don't get 7 gold I get a berserker and of course as always best of luck with those person or chests
from the reward track
please
we are going straight back in the
it's done as we can I'm not sure it will get to the loyalty token just tonight if not it'll happen on Tuesday when we start Nursery
but we might get to tonight I've got to drop another flight bear down let's drop off like they're at right now
let's pray that flag
I can easily finish that crossword in the night don't forget if you do finish request you do need to go and hand in the quest screen over here
you don't get your reward from your quest
very very important pick up the quest rewards that give you shiny things
of course everybody loves shiny things I know because I love shiny things and everybody else should as well
right now what we need to do is when you get back in the 80s we've just completed the learning bone hydra
it is that time
instant treasure warm with solo on cash anyway that
We Won't Take That
treasure would be good normally
we are short on the cache require to do that low
whatever you're coming in here
have another battle going on
this battle is going to be the Daedalus hammer
that is our reward this time we love the date of the summer
we still got the Ethernet for another 5
five encounters will be fine it is excellent
that goddaughter is excellent too
adult serious damage
what's the hammer give me
asteroid hits three times with dashes 25% less range
that is ok
that is OK actually
or Take That
we don't need the dash between
Rivers on fingers and that triple he's going to be bonkers
where I can find a short of money let's take the money
I'm health
always take the house
a checkout that damage
best triple hits r
doing some serious work here
what have you got no
the regeneration for you thank you very much
all for you
ask thank you very much
we have a shop we have cash
we got the cash to take to the shop
health
self
you are not we do
this is a rapid fight
if I won't shielded they have been dead already
112 health back yes thank you very much
good news 112 but
read 45
set the shop
ok we have
baboon yes
especially Netflix Doom
what's the best of the three
testify
I certainly near the end asking to be more valuable
escape the gym as well because
why wouldn't we
and we got a child of the Gods
trial of the gods is always worth it you get to Boons for the price of one
September the 1st
10 stacks of chill causes of blast
yes
show me things are always fun
Whitney Davies guns online
level up MIDI
he'll let me off
no I'll take that didn't thank you
yes
and that's only like a chaosgate
that is indeed a chaos getting but we don't have the house to take that
26 health required and we only have 45
if I take something that's going to take away half my health
matches that be lovely it's not going to be good for me
and I could buy this house and then take the day off and take the help from help from that that would work
that will take that
what type of Chaos heads
dive on in
I hope that we can
get send health back from now thank goodness
ok I was only others one exit this time anyway
what are we getting
see I like that
but I don't like 60% less movement speed
what really got
chaosbane
we do
percent damage
that's the same mechanic
I'm boots on strike as well
Will Take That
I will take a damage my boss
this is not going to end well I don't imagine
yeah the butterfly balls are annoying
when you can take them out you can get them out quick
girls become common and anxiety every three encounters that is a terrible idea right now
because I don't really want to be downgrading a bunch of stuff at this point
it takes 3 at random as well
yes revenge damage and completely chill
is that will stack with the
stacks of chill that caused the explosion
that is hopefully going to be bonkers
we've not seen a Cena for ages let's go and see a finer
more
OK well that ended ok
no it wasn't
what does she go off for me
she's not going with the dash strike
bonus god gauge thank you
what do we got now we got money or we got Hermes
we have no idea of money when you money
we have a shop coming up soon and to do the shop we need the money
I like this god power
I don't like only having for health but
there's a problem there's a meet you sold my darling
I'm good my chaos Boon
as replenished
have a shopping app on
can I see him over there but don't know over that refers to
shop
play the shop
definitely the shop
291
we're going into a boss fight which we always struggle with
this particular one
we can afford all the things
we're going to take the double strike
gonna take the whole for going to take the random upgrade
and then we go straight into the boss fight this is not going to go well
first over there yes it did but
are you doing a link it is good to see you
how's your evening been how's your weekend been
are you looking forward to having tomorrow off
and what are we going on
see what happens
I was going to happen is it going to start getting hit a lot
doing some damage as well
Frankie Knight god gauge right up
but dying immediately
he's having dionysius helping late
that is quite possibly the quickest of ever had a god gauge charge
I killed wow hello
that's the quickest one now fight
that is the quickest we've enjoyed that we've won that fight ever
and Bailey started and it was all over
ok well you got a good combo going on here
he died once but
that is a decent combo
complaint letter with Sanjay
understandable
outrageous behaviour but understandable
and I'm glad that you're doing good
nerdy key bank holidays are a good thing to have
are you guys get things like that we don't get over here
I really need some more House
there is a little bit
a bank holiday as a day when I do nothing
I wait no half-time as everyday
yes three day weekends are excellent
into the Temple of Styx
the Temple of Hades or whatever you want to call that I can't remember we haven't got much money
Renault parts near to break
we've got one justify left
this is not looking like a particularly good run but let's take the house
that's definitely start by taking the house
minimise damage speed us
he's doing it
this is an excellent combo but whether we're gonna survive because we take quite a lot damage at the same time
I don't know if we can behaviours with this
even with this insane amount damage
so as to keep the country running
and link who's that person
if you can't be died that would be appreciated
I'll take that Max life of which there was not enough
I like Davis enough money to afford a boon
what she got
resist damage from clothes
resist damage from clothes
give us anything else fun
is this insane damages all Zeus
anyway
almost all Zeus
yeah OK that was definitely quick
we don't want to lose any help we don't want my treasure
or do we
no I don't want to carry on through and try and get ourselves a couple more things from the shop
is there a Mist
chain lightning affects bounce more times
yes
and herself
mobile yourself
theoretically we could exit stage left at this point
I'm going to take that as a spoon
oh hello
Autotech high voltage for the
I want to set up for the fated Prophecy list
but that seems like it's gonna basically double my damage again
I think I actually the double damages the wise are options here because we are going to Hades fight very underpowered
fishing spot
fish
try this with a comma
you will see this legendary thing does indeed give us
even more stupid damage
it seems to
oh yeah that's working
very very definitely working at full power
we don't want to take any buttons off
even though we can sell them some money
where's that damn well is over here
ok that took a lot of Health office
what are we going to have
47% chance for double strike yes
that was a less sensible option
favourite boxer minibus
robust of fight in terms of actually being
effective fighting against them
probably learning Hayes l thank you so much for that hosts great to see how you doing
it's the most enjoyable boss by think of a lot
Hull
double level boost
hey glitter spots how you doing
double level boost
this is insanely good what do we want
I think we can take this under Dash
the question is do we risk losing more health
I take an animal snowy don't we're already scuppered anyway
it is not a good situation to be going into fighting
use Waze
29 health we are going to die very quickly
we got 1 testify
this is not 13357
not a good way to start this fight
the best if I will give us another hundred House
but he goes identify as well
this is not an excellent start
SMS welcome back
how you doing
we got to try
RPG session done bookkeeping this week fair enough
is very grumpy
they always sets fire to escape
and it's not the right way to look after your clothing
navigate that's hard test if I gone
we've only got one more desk is gonna come quite quickly I think
yep make him quick
burning wheel system
apparently do trade vouchers in cost-of-living rolls ok
button Clark's house on the cleaner easier
in what switch on approve this is not a fluke this is not going well
hey bunny welcome how you doing great to see you there
welcome to the stream how are you doing tonight
I'm good glad to hear it
welcome to the stream how do you find us
let's have a look around and see you as well and are you where people would be played it before
to see good gameplay possibly the wrong place
entertainment however you're in the right place
lesbian interracial
just download it on PlayStation won't be replying it yes I'm fine on PC but I'm using Xbox controller because controller is the way to play this game
it is a fantastic game it is very dict if you are not gonna see anything else for the rest of your life
you will keep playing this forever
I've been doing some fishing which is why it is given with police
am I going to talk to Meg
that'll be the stuff I keep giving them
the employee of the Month poster
Domino's employee of the Month this month
what have you got over here we have our mirror
not got enough to upgrade anything it
we are going to go straight into another run
this run is going to kick off
VXR Griffin I dislike this weapon
because we get the bonus
hello
s Kelly
so we get the bonus darkness from it's an annoying weapon to fight with
before we get this right up for going to do Stratus it is that time
3 minutes before you'll be able to get in the next battle in about 2 minutes time
so what we gonna do I am going to throw down
a defensive spell on this lot I think
56 hours on the field let's rock and roll
45mm this shouldn't be too bad we should be able to kill this quite quickly
you place units once every 5-minutes for a total of 6 per half hour then at the end of the half hour we have a bit of a battle we turned up at the NEC how many kill them we can kill hopefully we kill more of them they kill us
all of them they don't kill all of us then we win and then people get rewards and then we do the Loot and go back in the do it again
completely free-to-play and at the end of this when we start next battle you will see a link come up and you hit that link that gets you into the battle you place a units you get involved completely can drop all you guys I have no control over what happens except like one unit down at the start and one spell at the end and other than that I just sit here watch I let it run and it's all down to you
in this case we got extra matrica sitting there on the top of the kills because I seen at the top of the leaderboard
extra m getting knocked off my bench for right at the last second there
same between Saturday the most of this the whole time so with me if you take the top spot the most kills and the most assist you are guaranteed a reward on this next page
unfortunately to call 3 those but vengeful ventrilo
put the most girls with Nike sign them to Nice assist with five and took the overall top spot so that was going out completely at random
cutie zerker getting a century in school an extra metre picking a couple of barbarian Scrolls
get 7 Gold Coast
the lift I get a flying roke and of course you get those personal chests
so this is how you get involved there is a link coming up in any second-hand you hit that link
latest headache get on over the streamers website
units place and down on the battlefield
I said you get one every 5-minutes I get one now and that's my lot
at the end there are quest to do
quest a good quest rewards
105 flight m
so you can do the quests let me know by the way if you have a quest says you need to follow battle plan and I will place a battle plan for you
you don't have one and you don't ask I won't develop London because
give you guys the choice
never hit that link get yourself in on the rattle
for the next half hour will have another fight near the end of the Stream
tell them what we do is we can head back in the 80s and we can start this run with the xograph and see how that goes
we are not taking anything on the gauge because on the
you don't like status but yet he gets upset when we go and get one
it's a shame
so let's start by taking the moon the moon is good
what is the thing you can do this
give us a choice of three as always
define dash hello that is the one that I like that's the one I want to see to give us every time
the dash that deflects
that is a chaosgate that immediately means that we lose house but we get to go and get something fun
at this point in the junction where we got myself
is not a problem to take care
especially when I forgot to switch off my trinket so we're running with the health regen drink it anyway
normally I touch it out
take a different drink it to begin with
is it going to rain all health run
it's coming all health run away
so what are we going to do
go onto the next four encounter them 50% bonus gold all the way through
good
can't we can't collect spells for 14 hours seconds after was distracted boosted
or preview rewarder hidden and then 30% damage
we always struggle for gold
play the gold
taking a general Ward immediately which is not gold but we'll get some
so we can't turn any gold yet because that's what this does
navigate
grenade launcher goat
always try and diagnose it's because they hurt
and gems followed by gems ok
latest virus getting in some kind of one's there I think
auditel can't see all that well
some people love this gone all the people dislike it
definitely the latter can't I do not really enjoy all that much
I will take those gems though
Anna house
and we can't earn any money I don't think at this point no we can't
so epic staff of Magic power excellent so we can't turn this reward here
which is kind of annoying
I can't get any money out that gold pot with money in it
yeah I've seen that he got taken away from us
will take the help though
we're just checking the ports to make sure there's no health in any of them
and I'm going to die straight back in
I'm going to take them down
I'm good
an hour an extra money
extra money is much better than no money
let's or dash damage
that does it we're going into a minibus
Minnie Mouse is fine
except for this minibuses jobs around and around is a nuisance
I said it's a nuisance it is but you know occasionally managed it
no don't get extra to the people on earth
attacking flips doing that is what I was after a previous run
doom is very very good indeed
the darkness because the darkness is also health
it is a power boost we've got
by flexing Doom
a basic sat on them as well
hurts the most order much faster
always a good thing to do
or we can have a shop the shop means we don't have to fight so we take the shop
because a few fights the better
any gold dots note
a pots of you will not get the car and fight this time
I can take this and upon
yes let's take both
let's give ourselves
better doom doom all the Doom
all the Doom
yeah what's the doing with the Doom is doing things
ok and we have the choice
single god we have a dual god let's take the dual god
the dual guard
trial which gives a few balloons
will take a Cena first
what's Athena give us
cost of closing a small earring and deflect
deflect also makes clothes exposed
oh Holy shield
exposed definitely
no that's ok he's grumpy until we kill everything and I'll be happy again
everything
are we having a god call
so I kind of hoping that Aries might give us one
juices good
do effects do more damage when applied multiple times
yes
better and the Daedalus hammer and the house would be good
data samurai upgrades on weapon
is better
hello
special items rocket the deals.at damage
attack pieces phones yes
the special rock it would be cool
the attack piercing
this is a difficult choice
Mrs Wiggum go fishing that's an obvious choice
fishing is always the right choice
awkward
the difficult choice here is
switch with overload so we can easily deal with
shop what's your mum's losing nothing at all
the shop is the place to be
the shop is very definitely close to be
even though we can't afford to buy anything from you except the thing we don't need
probably in the shop we don't have to watch you take any damage
so go straight on through Wi-Fi whichever the theories is going to be here
Mick
wiki required
come and have a word with you
come and sort your missus out for us
imperious
I didn't authorise that
yeah glitter no it's not do so I'm afraid
I'll take that had the health that's been put there though
Josh is grumpy today
yeah he died
that's ok we got to testify
she didn't like that
just trying it's not necessary succeeding
to go out one testify but you know
small price to pay for Gillingham
Beth Farrell
if she wants to attack me then I'm going to give it back
Everton game plus 25 health but almost all of our money
there's not
let's head on through
it is possibly the last one tonight we might get one more enough this
and I quickly die
I dislike ask for that I said it was better than some regions
and Ricky ok we can do a key
we need any keys at 9 we can do a key fight
this guy is annoying
let's take that key
I got over here we got some parts which we need to smash just in case I can turn out
there may or may not be helped to pick up
you check anyway
is all houses good house
and we got a person in Council which means it's give a fight
there's a few fights the more survival
more about me when we skip a fight we also get given
baboon or Cabanas
she don't seem very happy about this
ok yeah I'm being rarity
let's take the upgrade two of our existing
and it's just trying to hurt me tomorrow
no don't hang around or maybe not a fight
I used to chat with Hermes
Hermes
that's gotta cool
better
rapid fire gun better
Phantom
and then a minibus
didn't need
minibus Peugeot
luckily I'm well equipped for the
flexlock
I like Dempsey said that was quite a call on
unintended
will take that again
put some serious damage
I have money or money and I guess we're going to take money
I like being ordered if lately spells back on them
plantar flexion is far too useful against them
more about please
are we can take a life for a Jenna
we got to go to mini bus
that life region
I need it
around here before we go
nothing useful ok
take me to watch some gemstones
gemstones 1 hours to upgrade the house
cancel better South we didn't really need this will take it anyway
where these enemies are Stephanie Dunham easier somewhere
that wasn't very pleasant
got two bottles of gloves
nice or end boss when you say end boss do you mean you got to Hades or giving you got to Theseus in a serious
is there two different ways to interpret that
you mean you got nowhere to hide is and that's really good going because you've barely been playing it lol
are you playing the God mode on a replay normal
curiosity
play MS in normal mode
50 Cent health and got killed in two shots see you that's on that happens
Hades and don't forget he has a data file as well so
50% help is actually 25% of the way through
how many runs has he done now
god mode on ok
maybe I should try that sometime
I think I like god mode I probably be well through the story by now
I'm playing it on normal mode which hurts quite a lot more

do I have health up when I pick up nectar
I don't tend to pick up my lunch next to her

like that see
I scream it's almost on a Sunday
we have a battle to do we have a nice chunky country units down here
I think I'm going to do is going to work a house bell on all that lot
this time we got 61 Hours on the field
crushing so let's rock and roll for last one tonight
cheers be kicking off that kill List going to write at the start going straight at the top
Vauxhall Vectra metrakit she's going for it she's going hard for it tonight
she's got the top she got the most assists she gonna take the most kills as well she's trying
just trying with the most kills is she going to take him
steal the trifecta is she going
with everything
she's trying she's very definitely trying
videos for getting knocked down by Aventura Logie
you going to retake it is eventually going to sit there on the top kills
are we going to see Ventura hold that we're going to see extra metre can get the trophax I wouldn't guarantee as a reward
what is going to happen anything could happen in the next few seconds
she's taking me back if you can hold it if somebody was going to take it
watch and see
looks like she's taking it but we won't know until it happens
there's still a rock there still some answer the rock
they are slowly moving towards their lots of them
electrical Templar up there but there's a whole bunch of other tanks and units coming along as well
is that universal 500 we going to see if somebody knocked off the top spot
are we going to see anything happen like that
me or not she's taking it there's no catching up now
that is a trifecta that is a guaranteed reward
astrometric taking the most kills with 16 Isis with 10 and the overall tops what with that combine 26
that guaranteed reward would you like a berserker scroll 50 gold or 50 gold
choice is yours let us know in those that doesn't a random but you
21 wonders circa 50 gold or 50 gold 150 gold or 50 gold is going to be very difficult choice for the scroll that is a very wise choice indeed
composite Kirkcaldy delivery water around mksp and twin 50th pickup 50 gold
seven and I get a centurion for me troubles
and that point it is that time of the night
it is that time where first and foremost
we queue the music
secondly we say that we are going to go for a ride
which would be great if you hang around 4
if you hang around for that we get this
with somebody else
I am not going to sing a traumatic that is not how this works
what we'll do is we are going to go and ride
